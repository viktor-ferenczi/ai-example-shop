I'm sorry for any confusion, but the issue you've mentioned is not related to the provided code. The code provided does not include any 'TODO' comments. However, I can help you with the issue you've mentioned regarding the 'TODO' comment.

Here's how you can resolve the issue:

1. Review the code to understand the context and the purpose of the method.
2. Identify the parameter that is causing the ambiguity.
3. Rename the parameter to a more meaningful name that reflects its purpose in the context of the method.

Here's a possible solution for the method `GetFilteredFoods(string q)`:

```cs
public IEnumerable<Food> GetFilteredFoods(string searchQuery)
{
    // ...
}
```

After making these changes, you can approve the code changes by saying "APPROVE_CHANGES".
