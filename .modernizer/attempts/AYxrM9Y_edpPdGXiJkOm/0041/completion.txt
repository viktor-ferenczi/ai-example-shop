I'm sorry, but the original source code you provided does not contain the 'TODO' comment you mentioned. However, based on the context you provided, I can suggest a solution for the issue you're referring to.

Here's how you can resolve the issue:

1. Identify the method with the 'TODO' comment. In this case, it's the `GetFilteredFoods(string searchQuery)` method.

2. Review the method's parameters. The method parameter `searchQuery` is not clear. It could be renamed to something more descriptive, like `searchTerm` or `filter`.

3. Update the method name and parameter to reflect the change.

Here's the updated code:

```cs
public IEnumerable<Food> GetFilteredFoods(string filter)
{
    const int defaultCount = 10;
    var queries = string.IsNullOrEmpty(filter) ? null : Regex.Replace(filter, @"\s+", " ").Trim().ToLower().Split(" ");
    if (queries == null)
    {
        return GetPreferred(defaultCount);
    }

    return GetAll().Where(item => queries.Any(query => (item.Name.ToLower().Contains(query))));
}
```
