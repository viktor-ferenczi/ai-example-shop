I'm sorry for any confusion, but the issue you've mentioned doesn't seem to be directly related to the provided source code. The code you've provided is a service class for managing food items in an ASP.NET service based on .NET Core. The issue you've mentioned is about the naming of a method parameter, but it's not clear which method this refers to. 

If you could provide more context or clarify the issue, I would be happy to assist further.
