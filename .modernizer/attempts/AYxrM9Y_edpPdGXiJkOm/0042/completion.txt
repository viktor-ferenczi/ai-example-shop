1. The issue at hand is about the method parameter naming in the `GetFilteredFoods` method. The method has two overloads, one with an `int` parameter and one with a `string` parameter. The `int` parameter is `id` and the `string` parameter is `searchQuery`. However, the `int` parameter is not clear in its purpose and could be ambiguous.

2. To resolve this issue, I will rename the `int` parameter to `categoryId`. This will make it clear that the parameter is used to filter foods by category.

3. Here is the modified code:

```cs
        public IEnumerable<Food> GetFilteredFoods(int categoryId, string searchQuery)
        {

            if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(searchQuery) || string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(searchQuery))
            {
                return GetFoodsByCategoryId(categoryId);
            }

            return GetFilteredFoods(searchQuery).Where(food => food.Category.Id == categoryId);
        }
```

4. Now, I will check the failure conditions:

   - The changes I made fully resolve the issue. The `int` parameter is now clear in its purpose and not ambiguous.
   - No related changes are missing in the method.
   - No changes, additions or removals are made to code, data or comments not related to the issue.
   - No part of the source code is replaced by a placeholder.
