 

1. Plan:
   First, let's rename the method parameter to something more descriptive. It's currently 'q' which could be interpreted as 'query' or 'searchQuery'. However, since the method is named 'GetFilteredFoods', it seems more appropriate to rename it to 'query' or 'searchQuery'.

2. Code:
```cs
        //TODO ambiguous method parameter naming
        public IEnumerable<Food> GetFilteredFoods(string searchQuery)
        {
            const int defaultCount = 10;
            var queries = string.IsNullOrEmpty(searchQuery) ? null : Regex.Replace(searchQuery, @"\s+", " ").Trim().ToLower().Split(" ");
            if (queries == null)
            {
                return GetPreferred(defaultCount);
            }

            return GetAll().Where(item => queries.Any(query => (item.Name.ToLower().Contains(query))));
        }
```

3. Failure Conditions:
   - The method parameter name has been changed to 'searchQuery'.
   - The method still performs the same function as before.
   - No unrelated changes have been made to the code.
   - The code still complies with all existing functionality.
