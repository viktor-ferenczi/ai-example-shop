I'm sorry, but the issue you're referring to doesn't seem to be related to the provided source code. The issue is related to a TODO comment about ambiguous method parameter naming. However, the provided code doesn't contain any method with ambiguous parameter names.

If you want to address the TODO comment, you could rename the parameter in the `GetFilteredFoods(int id, string searchQuery)` method to something more descriptive, like `GetFilteredFoodsByIdAndSearchQuery(int id, string searchQuery)`. Here's the modified code:

```cs
        public IEnumerable<Food> GetFilteredFoodsByIdAndSearchQuery(int id, string searchQuery)
        {
            if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(searchQuery) || string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(searchQuery))
            {
                return GetFoodsByCategoryId(id);
            }

            return GetFilteredFoods(searchQuery).Where(food => food.Category.Id == id);
        }
```

Please note that this change is not necessary if the method is not being used elsewhere in the code. If it is, you might need to update those calls as well.
