 
The issue reported is related to the exception message in the `DeleteFood` method. The current exception message is not meaningful and does not provide any information about the error that occurred. 

Here is the modified code:

```cs
public void DeleteFood(int id)
{
    var food = GetById(id);
    if (food == null)
    {
        throw new ArgumentException($"Food with id {id} does not exist.");
    }
    _context.Remove(food);
    _context.SaveChanges();
}
```

In this modified code, we are providing a meaningful exception message when the food item does not exist. This message will help the caller of the `DeleteFood` method to understand what went wrong and how to fix it.
