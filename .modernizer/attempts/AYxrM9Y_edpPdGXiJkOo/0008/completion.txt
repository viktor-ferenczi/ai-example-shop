 

1. Plan:
   To resolve the issue, we need to modify the `DeleteFood` method to throw a more meaningful exception message. We can do this by creating a custom exception class that inherits from `ArgumentException` and passing a custom message to it.

2. As the issue is reported at these code lines, but it may involve other lines, I will focus on these lines for the resolution.

3. Here is the modified code:

```cs
using System;

namespace Shop.Service
{
    public class FoodService : IFood
    {
        // ...

        public void DeleteFood(int id)
        {
            var food = GetById(id);
            if (food == null)
            {
                throw new FoodNotFoundException("Food with the provided id does not exist.");
            }
            _context.Remove(food);
            _context.SaveChanges();
        }

        // ...
    }

    public class FoodNotFoundException : ArgumentException
    {
        public FoodNotFoundException(string message) : base(message)
        {
        }
    }
}
```

4. Check these failure conditions:
   - The changes made to the `DeleteFood` method now throw a custom `FoodNotFoundException` with a meaningful message when the food with the provided id does not exist.
   - No related changes to other parts of the code are made.
   - No placeholders are used in the code.
   - The code is compatible with all existing functionality.
