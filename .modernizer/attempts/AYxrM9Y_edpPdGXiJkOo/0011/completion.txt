 
The issue reported is about the lack of a meaningful exception message when an invalid argument is passed to the `DeleteFood` method. This can make debugging more difficult, especially when dealing with multiple methods that can throw exceptions.

Here's a revised version of the `DeleteFood` method that includes a more meaningful exception message:

```cs
public void DeleteFood(int id)
{
    var food = GetById(id);
    if (food == null)
    {
        throw new ArgumentException($"No food with id {id} found to delete.");
    }
    _context.Remove(food);
    _context.SaveChanges();
}
```

In this revised version, an `ArgumentException` is thrown with a message that includes the id of the food that was not found. This makes it clear what the problem was, and it can help with debugging.
