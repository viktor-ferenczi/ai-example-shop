 
The issue is with the exception message. The ArgumentException thrown does not provide any context about what argument is invalid. This can make debugging difficult.

Here's a revised version of the DeleteFood method:

```cs
public void DeleteFood(int id)
{
    var food = GetById(id);
    if (food == null)
    {
        throw new ArgumentException($"Invalid food id: {id}");
    }
    _context.Remove(food);
    _context.SaveChanges();
}
```

In this revised version, an ArgumentException is thrown with a message that includes the invalid id. This makes it easier to debug and understand what went wrong.
