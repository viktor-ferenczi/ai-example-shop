 The issue reported is related to the way exceptions are handled in the code. The current implementation is throwing a generic `ArgumentException` without providing any meaningful information about the error. This can make debugging more difficult as the exception message is not descriptive.

Here's a revised version of the `DeleteFood` method:

```cs
public void DeleteFood(int id)
{
    var food = GetById(id);
    if (food == null)
    {
        throw new ArgumentException($"Food with ID {id} does not exist.");
    }
    _context.Remove(food);
    _context.SaveChanges();
}
```

In this revised version, we are throwing a `ArgumentException` with a custom message that includes the ID of the food that was not found. This provides more context and helps in debugging.

Please note that this is just one example and the actual implementation can vary based on the specific requirements and error handling strategy of your application.
