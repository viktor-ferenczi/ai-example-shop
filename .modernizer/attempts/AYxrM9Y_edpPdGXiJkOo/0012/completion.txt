 
The issue with the code is that the `ArgumentException` thrown when deleting a food item does not provide any meaningful information to the caller about what went wrong. This can make it difficult for the caller to understand the reason for the exception. 

Here is the revised code:

```cs
public void DeleteFood(int id)
{
    var food = GetById(id);
    if (food == null)
    {
        throw new ArgumentException($"No food item found with id: {id}");
    }
    _context.Remove(food);
    _context.SaveChanges();
}
```

In this revised code, an `ArgumentException` is thrown with a message indicating that no food item was found with the provided id. This makes it easier for the caller to understand why the exception was thrown and how to fix the issue.
