 
I'm sorry, but the issue you've mentioned seems to be a misunderstanding. The static code analysis tool you're using is suggesting that you use a constructor overloads that allows a more meaningful exception message to be provided. However, the code you've provided does not contain any constructor overloads.

To address this issue, you can modify the `DeleteFood` method to include a more meaningful exception message. Here's how you can do it:

```cs
public void DeleteFood(int id)
{
    var food = GetById(id);
    if (food == null)
    {
        throw new ArgumentException("No food found with the given ID.");
    }
    _context.Remove(food);
    _context.SaveChanges();
}
```

In this modified version, an `ArgumentException` is thrown with a custom message "No food found with the given ID." if the food with the given ID does not exist.

Please let me know if you need help with anything else.
