 
Based on the provided information, the issue is related to the lack of table headers in the "latestFoodsTable" table. This issue is categorized as a "MAJOR" issue.

Here's a step-by-step plan for resolving the issue:

1. Identify the table headers that should be included. Since the table is displaying food items, we could include headers such as "Food Name", "Description", "Price", etc.

2. Add the table headers to the table. We can do this by adding a `<thead>` section to the table, and inside this section, we can add a `<tr>` element with `<th>` elements for each header.

Here's the modified source code:

```cshtml
<div class="row frontPageContent">
    <h3 id="latestFoods">Search result</h3>
    @if (Model.FoodsList.Any())
    {
        <table class="table table-hover" id="latestFoodsTable">
            <caption>Table of Foods</caption>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Food Name</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                    <th>Price</th>
                    <!-- Add more headers as needed -->
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                @foreach (var food in Model.FoodsList)
                {
                    <tr>
                        <td>
                           @Html.Partial("FoodSummary", food) 
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                }
            </tbody>
        </table>
    }
    else
    {
        <h4>It looks like there are no search results...</h4>
    }
</div>
```

In this modified code, I've added a `<thead>` section with a `<tr>` element containing `<th>` elements for each header. You can add more headers as needed based on the data you're displaying in the table.
