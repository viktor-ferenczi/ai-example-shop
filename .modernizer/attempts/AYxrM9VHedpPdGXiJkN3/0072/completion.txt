 
I'm sorry, but the code you provided does not seem to have any method with more than 7 parameters. The method `GetFilteredOrders` has 9 parameters, but they are all optional and have default values. This does not count towards the total number of parameters.

However, if you want to reduce the number of parameters in this method, you could consider using a `FilterOptions` object or similar to encapsulate all the optional parameters. This would make the method signature cleaner and easier to understand.

Here's an example of how you could refactor the method:

```cs
public class FilterOptions
{
    public string UserId { get; set; }
    public OrderBy OrderBy { get; set; } = OrderBy.None;
    public int Offset { get; set; } = 0;
    public int Limit { get; set; } = 10;
    public decimal? MinimalPrice { get; set; }
    public decimal? MaximalPrice { get; set; }
    public DateTime? MinDate { get; set; }
    public DateTime? MaxDate { get; set; }
    public string ZipCode { get; set; }
}

IEnumerable<Order> GetFilteredOrders(FilterOptions options);
```

This way, you can pass all the options as a single object, which reduces the number of parameters in the method.
