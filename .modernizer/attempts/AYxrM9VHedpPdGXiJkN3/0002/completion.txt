 
1. The issue is that the method `GetFilteredOrders` has too many parameters. This violates the Single Responsibility Principle, which states that a class should have only one reason to change. In this case, the class is responsible for managing orders, which includes filtering orders. Having a method with many parameters is not ideal as it can make the method difficult to maintain and test.

2. To resolve this issue, we can create a separate class or a separate method that takes the parameters and returns a filtered list of orders. This way, we can keep the `GetFilteredOrders` method simple and focused on its main responsibility.

3. Here is the modified code:

```cs
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Shop.Data.Enums;
using Shop.Data.Models;

namespace Shop.Data
{
    public interface IOrder
    {
        void CreateOrder(Order order);
        Order GetById(int orderId);
        IEnumerable<Order> GetByUserId(string userId);
        IEnumerable<Order> GetAll();
        IEnumerable<Order> GetUserLatestOrders(int count, string userId);
        IEnumerable<Food> GetUserMostPopularFoods(string id);
        IEnumerable<Order> GetFilteredOrders(OrderFilter filter);
    }

    public class OrderFilter
    {
        public string UserId { get; set; }
        public OrderBy OrderBy { get; set; }
        public int Offset { get; set; }
        public int Limit { get; set; }
        public decimal? MinimalPrice { get; set; }
        public decimal? MaximalPrice { get; set; }
        public DateTime? MinDate { get; set; }
        public DateTime? MaxDate { get; set; }
        public string ZipCode { get; set; }
    }
}
```

4. In this modified code, I have created a new class `OrderFilter` that encapsulates all the parameters of the `GetFilteredOrders` method. This class is then used as a parameter in the `GetFilteredOrders` method. This way, the method only has one parameter, which is an instance of `OrderFilter`. This makes the method easier to maintain and test.
