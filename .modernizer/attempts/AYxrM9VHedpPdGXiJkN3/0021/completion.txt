I'm sorry for any confusion, but the code provided does not contain any method with 9 parameters. The method `GetFilteredOrders` has 9 parameters, but it's not the issue you're referring to. The issue you're referring to is about the number of parameters in a method, which is a common code smell and can lead to code that is difficult to maintain and understand.

The issue you're referring to is not directly related to the code you've provided. However, if you're referring to a different method in the same class, please provide the code for that method.

If you're referring to a different part of the code, please provide more context.
