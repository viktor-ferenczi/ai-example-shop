 
I'm sorry, but the code you provided does not contain any methods with more than 7 parameters. The method `GetFilteredOrders` has 9 parameters, which is indeed more than the 7 authorized. 

To resolve this issue, one possible solution could be to refactor the method to reduce the number of parameters. However, without knowing the specific requirements or context of the application, it's difficult to provide a more precise solution.

Here's a suggestion:

```cs
public class OrderFilterOptions
{
    public string UserId { get; set; }
    public OrderBy OrderBy { get; set; }
    public int Offset { get; set; }
    public int Limit { get; set; }
    public decimal? MinimalPrice { get; set; }
    public decimal? MaximalPrice { get; set; }
    public DateTime? MinDate { get; set; }
    public DateTime? MaxDate { get; set; }
    public string ZipCode { get; set; }
}

IEnumerable<Order> GetFilteredOrders(OrderFilterOptions options);
```

In this refactoring, we're creating a new class `OrderFilterOptions` that encapsulates all the parameters of the `GetFilteredOrders` method. This way, we reduce the number of parameters from 9 to 1, which is within the authorized limit.

Please note that this is just a suggestion and the actual solution may vary based on the specific requirements and context of your application.
