I'm sorry, but the issue you've provided seems to be a static code analysis issue, not a bug or a feature request. It seems like the static code analysis tool is reporting that the method `GetFilteredOrders` has more than the authorized number of parameters.

To resolve this issue, we could consider refactoring the method to reduce the number of parameters. However, without more context, it's hard to provide a precise solution.

If the method is indeed too complex and needs refactoring, we could consider breaking it down into smaller, more manageable methods. This could involve creating a separate method for each distinct piece of functionality.

If the method is indeed necessary to have all these parameters, then we could consider using a design pattern like the Builder pattern or the Factory pattern to manage the creation of complex objects with many parameters.

Please provide more context or clarify the issue if you need a more specific solution.
