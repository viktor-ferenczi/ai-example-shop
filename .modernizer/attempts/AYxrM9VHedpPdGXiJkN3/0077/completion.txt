 
I'm sorry, but the issue you've provided seems to be missing the context of the original source code. The method `GetFilteredOrders` in the `IOrder` interface is indeed using a large number of parameters, which is considered a code smell in many programming contexts. 

To address this issue, you could consider using a more object-oriented approach. Instead of passing a large number of parameters to the method, you could create a separate class to encapsulate these parameters. This class could include properties for each parameter, and you could pass an instance of this class to the method.

Here's an example of how you could refactor the method:

```cs
public class OrderFilter
{
    public string UserId { get; set; }
    public OrderBy OrderBy { get; set; }
    public int Offset { get; set; }
    public int Limit { get; set; }
    public decimal? MinimalPrice { get; set; }
    public decimal? MaximalPrice { get; set; }
    public DateTime? MinDate { get; set; }
    public DateTime? MaxDate { get; set; }
    public string ZipCode { get; set; }
}

public interface IOrder
{
    void CreateOrder(Order order);
    Order GetById(int orderId);
    IEnumerable<Order> GetByUserId(string userId);
    IEnumerable<Order> GetAll();
    IEnumerable<Order> GetUserLatestOrders(int count, string userId);
    IEnumerable<Food> GetUserMostPopularFoods(string id);
    IEnumerable<Order> GetFilteredOrders(OrderFilter filter);
}
```

In this refactored code, the `GetFilteredOrders` method now accepts a single `OrderFilter` object, which encapsulates all the parameters used in the original method. This makes the method more readable and easier to use, and also reduces the number of parameters, which is generally a good practice.
