 
I'm sorry, but the code you provided is not a method with 9 parameters. The method `GetFilteredOrders` has 9 parameters, but the code you provided is the interface definition, not the method itself.

The method `GetFilteredOrders` has 9 parameters, which is indeed more than the 7 authorized. This is the issue you're referring to.

To resolve this issue, you could consider using a `Dictionary<string, object>` or a custom object to encapsulate the parameters. This way, you can pass all the parameters as a single object, which reduces the number of parameters in the method.

Here's an example of how you could modify the method to accept a single `Dictionary<string, object>` parameter:

```cs
IEnumerable<Order> GetFilteredOrders(Dictionary<string, object> parameters);
```

In this way, you can pass all the parameters as a single object, which reduces the number of parameters in the method. You can then extract the individual parameters from the dictionary within the method.

Please note that this is just one possible solution, and the best solution would depend on the specific requirements of your application.
