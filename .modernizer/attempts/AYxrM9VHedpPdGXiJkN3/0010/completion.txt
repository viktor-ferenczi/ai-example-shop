 
I'm sorry, but the issue you've provided doesn't seem to be related to the original source code provided. The static code analysis found an issue with the `GetFilteredOrders` method, which has more than the authorized 7 parameters. 

However, the issue is not related to the original source code provided. The static code analysis found an issue with the `GetFilteredOrders` method, which has more than the authorized 7 parameters. 

To resolve this issue, you could consider refactoring the method to reduce the number of parameters. One possible solution is to create a separate class or struct to hold the parameters, and pass an instance of this class or struct to the method instead of passing the parameters individually.

Here's a simple example:

```cs
public class OrderFilter
{
    public string UserId { get; set; }
    public OrderBy OrderBy { get; set; }
    public int Offset { get; set; }
    public int Limit { get; set; }
    public decimal? MinimalPrice { get; set; }
    public decimal? MaximalPrice { get; set; }
    public DateTime? MinDate { get; set; }
    public DateTime? MaxDate { get; set; }
    public string ZipCode { get; set; }
}

public IEnumerable<Order> GetFilteredOrders(OrderFilter filter);
```

In this way, you can reduce the number of parameters in the `GetFilteredOrders` method to one, which is within the authorized limit.
