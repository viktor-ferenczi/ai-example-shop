I'm sorry, but the code you provided does not contain any method with 9 parameters. The method `GetFilteredOrders` has 9 parameters, but it's not the issue you're referring to.

The issue you're referring to is about the number of parameters in a method. According to the static code analysis, the method `GetFilteredOrders` has 9 parameters, which is greater than the 7 authorized.

To resolve this issue, you could consider using a class or struct to encapsulate the parameters, instead of passing them individually. This would reduce the number of parameters, as well as making the code easier to read and maintain.

Here's an example of how you could refactor the method:

```cs
public class OrderFilter
{
    public string UserId { get; set; }
    public OrderBy OrderBy { get; set; }
    public int Offset { get; set; }
    public int Limit { get; set; }
    public decimal? MinimalPrice { get; set; }
    public decimal? MaximalPrice { get; set; }
    public DateTime? MinDate { get; set; }
    public DateTime? MaxDate { get; set; }
    public string ZipCode { get; set; }
}

IEnumerable<Order> GetFilteredOrders(OrderFilter filter);
```

In this refactored code, the `GetFilteredOrders` method now takes a single parameter of type `OrderFilter`, which encapsulates all the filter parameters. This reduces the number of parameters from 9 to 1, which is within the authorized limit.
