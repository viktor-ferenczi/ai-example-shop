I'm sorry, but the issue you've described is not a typical issue that can be resolved through code refactoring. The code analysis report indicates that the method `GetFilteredOrders` has more than the authorized number of parameters. This is a major issue because it violates the principle of "Single Responsibility" in object-oriented design, which suggests that a class or method should have only one responsibility.

To address this issue, you can consider the following approaches:

1. **Parameter Object Pattern**: Create a separate class to encapsulate the parameters for the `GetFilteredOrders` method. This class can be named `OrderFilter` or something similar, and it can include properties for each of the parameters. This approach makes the method simpler and more focused, and also makes it easier to add or remove parameters in the future.

2. **Introduce a Factory Method**: If the parameters for `GetFilteredOrders` are always used together, you can introduce a factory method that creates an instance of `Order` with the desired parameters. This method can be named `CreateOrder` or something similar. This approach makes the code more readable and easier to understand.

3. **Use a Builder Pattern**: If the parameters for `GetFilteredOrders` are optional and can be set in any order, you can use the Builder pattern to create instances of `Order`. This pattern allows you to set the parameters in any order and provides a clear and readable way to create complex objects.

Here is an example of how you might implement the Parameter Object Pattern:

```cs
public class OrderFilter
{
    public string UserId { get; set; }
    public OrderBy OrderBy { get; set; }
    public int Offset { get; set; }
    public int Limit { get; set; }
    public decimal? MinimalPrice { get; set; }
    public decimal? MaximalPrice { get; set; }
    public DateTime? MinDate { get; set; }
    public DateTime? MaxDate { get; set; }
    public string ZipCode { get; set; }
}

public interface IOrder
{
    // ...
    IEnumerable<Order> GetFilteredOrders(OrderFilter filter);
}
```

Please note that this is just one of many possible solutions. The best solution depends on the specific requirements and constraints of your application.
