 
I'm sorry, but the code provided does not contain any issues that match the description you provided. It seems that you are asking for a solution to a method having more than 7 parameters, which is a common code smell and is usually considered a bad practice in programming. 

However, if you are looking to refactor this method to reduce the number of parameters, you could consider using a class or a struct to encapsulate the parameters. This would make the method signature cleaner and easier to understand.

Here is an example:

```cs
public class OrderFilter
{
    public string UserId { get; set; }
    public OrderBy OrderBy { get; set; }
    public int Offset { get; set; }
    public int Limit { get; set; }
    public decimal? MinimalPrice { get; set; }
    public decimal? MaximalPrice { get; set; }
    public DateTime? MinDate { get; set; }
    public DateTime? MaxDate { get; set; }
    public string ZipCode { get; set; }
}

public IEnumerable<Order> GetFilteredOrders(OrderFilter filter);
```

In this example, the `OrderFilter` class encapsulates all the parameters of the `GetFilteredOrders` method, which makes the method signature cleaner and easier to understand.
