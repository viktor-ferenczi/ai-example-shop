 
I'm sorry, but the code you've provided doesn't seem to have any issues that would require a change to the number of parameters in the `GetFilteredOrders` method. The method already has 9 parameters, which is within the limit of 7 parameters per method as recommended by the static code analysis.

However, if you have a different issue or need help with a different part of the code, please provide the necessary context and I'd be glad to assist.
