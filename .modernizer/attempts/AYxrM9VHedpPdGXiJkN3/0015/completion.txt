 

1. Plan:
   The issue is a result of a method having too many parameters. This is a common code smell in object-oriented programming and can lead to code that is hard to maintain and understand. 

   One possible solution is to refactor the method into smaller, more focused methods. For instance, instead of having a single method with many parameters, we could have several methods each with fewer parameters. 

   Another approach could be to create a class that encapsulates the parameters and pass an instance of this class to the method. This would make the method signature cleaner and more readable.

2. Code:
   ```cs
   // TOP-MARKER
   using System;
   using System.Collections.Generic;
   using System.Threading.Tasks;
   using Shop.Data.Enums;
   using Shop.Data.Models;

   namespace Shop.Data
   {
       public interface IOrder
       {
           void CreateOrder(Order order);
           Order GetById(int orderId);
           IEnumerable<Order> GetByUserId(string userId);
           IEnumerable<Order> GetAll();
           IEnumerable<Order> GetUserLatestOrders(int count, string userId);
           IEnumerable<Food> GetUserMostPopularFoods(string id);
           IEnumerable<Order> GetFilteredOrders(OrderFilter filter);
       }

       public class OrderFilter
       {
           public string UserId { get; set; }
           public OrderBy OrderBy { get; set; }
           public int Offset { get; set; }
           public int Limit { get; set; }
           public decimal? MinimalPrice { get; set; }
           public decimal? MaximalPrice { get; set; }
           public DateTime? MinDate { get; set; }
           public DateTime? MaxDate { get; set; }
           public string ZipCode { get; set; }
       }
   }
   ```

3. Failure conditions:
   - The `GetFilteredOrders` method now takes a single parameter of type `OrderFilter`, which is a class that encapsulates all the parameters.
   - The `OrderFilter` class has properties for each of the parameters in the original method.
   - The `OrderFilter` class is defined within the same namespace as the `IOrder` interface.
   - The `OrderFilter` class is public, so it can be used outside of the `Shop.Data` namespace if needed.
   - The `OrderFilter` class does not have any methods or properties that are not related to the issue.
