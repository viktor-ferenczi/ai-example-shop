 
The issue you're facing is due to the fact that the method `GetFilteredOrders` has too many parameters. This is a common problem in programming, known as the "Long Parameter List" code smell. It can make the code harder to understand, maintain, and test.

A potential solution to this issue is to refactor the method to accept a single parameter of type `OrderFilter`, which would be a class that encapsulates all the filtering options. This approach would reduce the number of parameters from 9 to 1, which is a significant improvement.

Here's how you could refactor the `GetFilteredOrders` method:

```cs
public class OrderFilter
{
    public string UserId { get; set; }
    public OrderBy OrderBy { get; set; }
    public int Offset { get; set; }
    public int Limit { get; set; }
    public decimal? MinimalPrice { get; set; }
    public decimal? MaximalPrice { get; set; }
    public DateTime? MinDate { get; set; }
    public DateTime? MaxDate { get; set; }
    public string ZipCode { get; set; }
}

public IEnumerable<Order> GetFilteredOrders(OrderFilter filter)
{
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

In this refactored code, the `GetFilteredOrders` method now accepts a single parameter of type `OrderFilter`. This class encapsulates all the filtering options, making the method easier to read and maintain.
