I'm sorry, but the provided code snippet does not seem to contain any issue that matches the description you provided. The method `GetFilteredOrders` only has 9 parameters, which is within the authorized limit of 7 parameters. The code analysis error you mentioned seems to be related to a different method or a different part of the code.

If you have any other code snippet or a different issue you want me to help with, please provide it.
