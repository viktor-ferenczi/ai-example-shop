 
I'm sorry, but the code you provided doesn't seem to have any issues that match the description you provided. The method `GetFilteredOrders` has 9 parameters, which is within the acceptable limit of 7 parameters per method. 

However, if you want to improve the readability of the code, you could consider using an options object or a builder pattern to handle optional parameters. This would allow you to pass a single object to the method, which would contain all the optional parameters. This would make it easier to understand the method's signature and would also make it easier to add or remove parameters in the future.

Here's an example of how you could implement this:

```cs
public class OrderOptions
{
    public string UserId { get; set; }
    public OrderBy OrderBy { get; set; } = OrderBy.None;
    public int Offset { get; set; }
    public int Limit { get; set; } = 10;
    public decimal? MinimalPrice { get; set; }
    public decimal? MaximalPrice { get; set; }
    public DateTime? MinDate { get; set; }
    public DateTime? MaxDate { get; set; }
    public string ZipCode { get; set; }
}

IEnumerable<Order> GetFilteredOrders(OrderOptions options);
```

In this example, the `GetFilteredOrders` method would take a single `OrderOptions` object as its parameter, which would contain all the optional parameters. This would make it easier to understand the method's signature and would also make it easier to add or remove parameters in the future.
