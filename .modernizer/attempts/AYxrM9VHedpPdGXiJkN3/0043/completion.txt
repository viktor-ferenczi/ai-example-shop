 
I'm sorry for any confusion, but the issue you've described is not a code issue, but rather a static code analysis issue related to the number of parameters in the `GetFilteredOrders` method. 

The issue is that the method has more than 7 parameters, which is against the rule of having no more than 7 parameters. This is a best practice for readability and maintainability of code.

To resolve this issue, you could consider using a method overloading or creating a class to encapsulate the parameters. If this is not possible, you could consider refactoring the method to reduce the number of parameters.

Here's an example of how you could refactor the method to reduce the number of parameters:

```cs
public class OrderFilterOptions
{
    public string UserId { get; set; }
    public OrderBy OrderBy { get; set; }
    public int Offset { get; set; }
    public int Limit { get; set; }
    public decimal? MinimalPrice { get; set; }
    public decimal? MaximalPrice { get; set; }
    public DateTime? MinDate { get; set; }
    public DateTime? MaxDate { get; set; }
    public string ZipCode { get; set; }
}

IEnumerable<Order> GetFilteredOrders(OrderFilterOptions options);
```

In this refactoring, you create a new class `OrderFilterOptions` that encapsulates all the parameters of the `GetFilteredOrders` method. This makes the method more readable and maintainable, while still allowing you to filter orders based on the options provided.

Please note that this is just one possible solution, and the best solution will depend on the specific requirements and constraints of your project.
