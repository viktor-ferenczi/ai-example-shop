 
I'm sorry, but the code you provided does not contain any method with more than 7 parameters. It's the `GetFilteredOrders` method which has 9 parameters. If you want to reduce the number of parameters, you could consider using a class or struct to encapsulate the parameters, rather than passing them individually. Here's an example:

```cs
public class OrderFilterOptions
{
    public string UserId { get; set; }
    public OrderBy OrderBy { get; set; }
    public int Offset { get; set; }
    public int Limit { get; set; }
    public decimal? MinimalPrice { get; set; }
    public decimal? MaximalPrice { get; set; }
    public DateTime? MinDate { get; set; }
    public DateTime? MaxDate { get; set; }
    public string ZipCode { get; set; }
}
```

Then, you can modify the `GetFilteredOrders` method to accept an instance of `OrderFilterOptions`:

```cs
IEnumerable<Order> GetFilteredOrders(OrderFilterOptions options);
```

This way, you can pass all the options as a single object, which reduces the number of parameters and makes the code easier to read and maintain.
