 
I'm sorry, but the code you provided does not include any method with 9 parameters. The method `GetFilteredOrders` has 9 parameters, but it's not the issue you're asking about. The issue you're referring to is about a method with more than 7 parameters, which is not present in the code you provided.

If you're referring to a different method with more than 7 parameters, could you please provide the code for that method?
