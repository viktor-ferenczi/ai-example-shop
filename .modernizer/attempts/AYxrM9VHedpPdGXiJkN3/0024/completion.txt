 
I'm sorry, but the code you've provided does not contain any method with 9 parameters. The method `GetFilteredOrders` has 9 parameters, but it's not the issue you're referring to. The issue is with the `IOrder` interface, which has a method with 9 parameters.

To address this issue, you could consider using a `Dictionary` or a custom object to encapsulate the parameters. This way, you can reduce the number of parameters in the method and make the method more readable and maintainable.

Here's an example of how you could refactor the `GetFilteredOrders` method:

```cs
public class OrderFilter
{
    public string UserId { get; set; }
    public OrderBy OrderBy { get; set; }
    public int Offset { get; set; }
    public int Limit { get; set; }
    public decimal? MinimalPrice { get; set; }
    public decimal? MaximalPrice { get; set; }
    public DateTime? MinDate { get; set; }
    public DateTime? MaxDate { get; set; }
    public string ZipCode { get; set; }
}

IEnumerable<Order> GetFilteredOrders(OrderFilter filter);
```

In this refactoring, the `GetFilteredOrders` method now accepts a single `OrderFilter` object, which encapsulates all the parameters. This makes the method easier to read and maintain, and reduces the number of parameters, which is in line with the best practices.
