 
I'm sorry, but the issue you've described is not a coding issue, but a static code analysis issue. It's about a method having too many parameters, which is considered a bad practice in software design.

The method `GetFilteredOrders` has 9 parameters, which is considered a sign of high complexity and could be refactored to reduce the number of parameters.

One possible solution is to create a new class, say `OrderFilter`, which would encapsulate the parameters of the `GetFilteredOrders` method. The `OrderFilter` class could have properties for each parameter of the method. Then, the `GetFilteredOrders` method could take an instance of `OrderFilter` as a parameter.

Here is a simplified example of how this could look:

```cs
public class OrderFilter
{
    public string UserId { get; set; }
    public OrderBy OrderBy { get; set; }
    public int Offset { get; set; }
    public int Limit { get; set; }
    public decimal? MinimalPrice { get; set; }
    public decimal? MaximalPrice { get; set; }
    public DateTime? MinDate { get; set; }
    public DateTime? MaxDate { get; set; }
    public string ZipCode { get; set; }
}

public IEnumerable<Order> GetFilteredOrders(OrderFilter filter)
{
    // Implementation here
}
```

This way, the `GetFilteredOrders` method would only have one parameter, which is an instance of `OrderFilter`. The parameters of the method are now encapsulated in the `OrderFilter` class, which makes the method easier to understand and maintain.
