 
I'm sorry, but the issue you've described is not applicable to the provided source code. The method `GetFilteredOrders` has 9 parameters, but the code analysis reported an issue about the number of parameters in the method. This issue is not related to the number of parameters in the method, but to the complexity of the method itself.

The method `GetFilteredOrders` is indeed complex and has a high number of parameters. This could be a sign of a code smell, indicating that the method is doing too many things. It's also hard to test and maintain.

To resolve this issue, you could consider refactoring the method to make it more focused and easier to understand. Here are some suggestions:

1. Create a separate class to hold the parameters of the `GetFilteredOrders` method. This class could be named `OrderFilter` or something similar. The `OrderFilter` class could have properties for each of the parameters in the `GetFilteredOrders` method.

2. Instead of passing all the parameters to the `GetFilteredOrders` method, pass an instance of the `OrderFilter` class. This way, the method becomes more focused and easier to understand.

Here is an example of how you could refactor the `GetFilteredOrders` method:

```cs
public IEnumerable<Order> GetFilteredOrders(OrderFilter filter)
{
    // implementation of the method
}
```

And here is an example of how you could define the `OrderFilter` class:

```cs
public class OrderFilter
{
    public string UserId { get; set; }
    public OrderBy OrderBy { get; set; }
    public int Offset { get; set; }
    public int Limit { get; set; }
    public decimal? MinimalPrice { get; set; }
    public decimal? MaximalPrice { get; set; }
    public DateTime? MinDate { get; set; }
    public DateTime? MaxDate { get; set; }
    public string ZipCode { get; set; }
}
```

By following these steps, you can make the `GetFilteredOrders` method more focused and easier to understand and maintain.
