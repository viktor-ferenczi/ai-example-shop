I'm sorry for the confusion, but the code you provided does not have any method with more than 7 parameters. The method `GetFilteredOrders` has 9 parameters, but they are all optional and have default values. This is a common practice in C# to allow for flexible method calls.

However, if you want to reduce the number of parameters, you could consider creating a separate class to hold the filter parameters, and pass an instance of this class to the method instead. This would make the method signature cleaner and more readable.

Here's an example of how you could do this:

```cs
public class OrderFilter
{
    public string UserId { get; set; }
    public OrderBy OrderBy { get; set; }
    public int Offset { get; set; }
    public int Limit { get; set; }
    public decimal? MinimalPrice { get; set; }
    public decimal? MaximalPrice { get; set; }
    public DateTime? MinDate { get; set; }
    public DateTime? MaxDate { get; set; }
    public string ZipCode { get; set; }
}

public interface IOrder
{
    // ...

    IEnumerable<Order> GetFilteredOrders(OrderFilter filter);
}
```

In this way, you can pass an instance of `OrderFilter` to the `GetFilteredOrders` method, which reduces the number of parameters from 9 to 1.
