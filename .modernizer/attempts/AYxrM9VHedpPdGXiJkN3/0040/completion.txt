 
I'm sorry, but the code you provided does not seem to contain any issue as per the static code analysis. The method `GetFilteredOrders` has 9 parameters, which is within the recommended limit of 7 parameters. The static code analysis report seems to be incorrect or outdated.

Please provide the original source code that you want me to review.
