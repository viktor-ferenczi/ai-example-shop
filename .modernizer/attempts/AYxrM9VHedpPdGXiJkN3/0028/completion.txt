I'm sorry, but the issue you've mentioned is not directly related to the provided code. The code you've provided is an interface for an order service in an ASP.NET service based on .NET Core. The interface defines several methods for creating, retrieving and filtering orders.

The static code analysis issue you've mentioned is about a method with too many parameters, which is a common code smell in object-oriented programming. It's generally considered a bad practice because it can make the method difficult to use and understand.

To resolve this issue, you could consider using a design pattern like the Builder pattern or the Factory pattern to reduce the number of parameters in the method. However, without seeing the actual implementation of the `GetFilteredOrders` method, it's hard to provide a specific solution.

Here's an example of how you could refactor the `GetFilteredOrders` method to use a Builder pattern:

```cs
public class OrderFilter
{
    public string UserId { get; set; }
    public OrderBy OrderBy { get; set; }
    public int Offset { get; set; }
    public int Limit { get; set; }
    public decimal? MinimalPrice { get; set; }
    public decimal? MaximalPrice { get; set; }
    public DateTime? MinDate { get; set; }
    public DateTime? MaxDate { get; set; }
    public string ZipCode { get; set; }
}

public interface IOrder
{
    // ... other methods ...

    IEnumerable<Order> GetFilteredOrders(OrderFilter filter);
}
```

In this refactoring, the `GetFilteredOrders` method now takes a single `OrderFilter` object, which encapsulates all the parameters. This makes the method easier to use and understand, and reduces the chance of errors.
