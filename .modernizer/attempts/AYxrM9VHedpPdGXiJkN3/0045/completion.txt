 
I'm sorry, but the code you've provided doesn't seem to have any issues as per the static code analysis report. The method `GetFilteredOrders` has 9 parameters, which is within the limit of 7 parameters per method as per the rule of thumb. 

Here's the method:

```cs
IEnumerable<Order> GetFilteredOrders(
    string userId = null,
    OrderBy orderBy = OrderBy.None,
    int offset = 0,
    int limit = 10,
    decimal? minimalPrice = null,
    decimal? maximalPrice = null,
    DateTime? minDate = null,
    DateTime? maxDate = null,
    string zipCode = null
    );
```

If you have any other issues or need further assistance, please provide the relevant code and details.
