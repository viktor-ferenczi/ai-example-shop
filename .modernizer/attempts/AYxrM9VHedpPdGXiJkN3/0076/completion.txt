I'm sorry, but the code you provided does not contain any method with 9 parameters. It's actually the `GetFilteredOrders` method which has 9 parameters.

To resolve the issue, we can refactor the method to reduce the number of parameters. One possible solution is to create a separate class to hold the filtering parameters and pass an instance of this class to the `GetFilteredOrders` method.

Here's an example of how you can refactor the code:

```cs
public class OrderFilter
{
    public string UserId { get; set; }
    public OrderBy OrderBy { get; set; }
    public int Offset { get; set; }
    public int Limit { get; set; }
    public decimal? MinimalPrice { get; set; }
    public decimal? MaximalPrice { get; set; }
    public DateTime? MinDate { get; set; }
    public DateTime? MaxDate { get; set; }
    public string ZipCode { get; set; }
}

public interface IOrder
{
    // other methods...

    IEnumerable<Order> GetFilteredOrders(OrderFilter filter);
}
```

In this refactored code, the `GetFilteredOrders` method takes a single `OrderFilter` object which contains all the filtering parameters. This approach reduces the number of parameters in the method and makes the code easier to maintain and understand.
