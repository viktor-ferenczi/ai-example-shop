 I'm sorry, but the code you provided does not contain any method with 9 parameters. The method `GetFilteredOrders` has 9 parameters, but it seems to be the correct method in the context provided.

To resolve the issue, I would suggest to refactor the method to reduce the number of parameters. One possible solution could be to create a `FilterOptions` class that encapsulates all the filter parameters. This would reduce the number of parameters in the `GetFilteredOrders` method to one. Here is an example of how you could refactor the code:

```cs
public class FilterOptions
{
    public string UserId { get; set; }
    public OrderBy OrderBy { get; set; }
    public int Offset { get; set; }
    public int Limit { get; set; }
    public decimal? MinimalPrice { get; set; }
    public decimal? MaximalPrice { get; set; }
    public DateTime? MinDate { get; set; }
    public DateTime? MaxDate { get; set; }
    public string ZipCode { get; set; }
}

IEnumerable<Order> GetFilteredOrders(FilterOptions options);
```

In this refactoring, the `GetFilteredOrders` method now takes a single `FilterOptions` parameter instead of multiple parameters. This makes the method more readable and easier to maintain.
