 
I'm sorry for any confusion, but the issue reported is not related to the code provided. The static code analysis is pointing out that the `GetFilteredOrders` method has too many parameters, which is considered a code smell. It's generally recommended to keep the number of parameters in a method to a minimum to improve readability and maintainability. 

However, the method itself seems to be designed with optional parameters, which is a good practice in some cases. If the method is indeed designed to be used with optional parameters, then the issue is not a bug, but a code smell.

If you want to refactor the method to reduce the number of parameters, you could consider using a `FilterOptions` object or similar to encapsulate the parameters. This would make the method signature cleaner and more readable.

Here's an example of how you could refactor the method:

```cs
public class FilterOptions
{
    public string UserId { get; set; }
    public OrderBy OrderBy { get; set; } = OrderBy.None;
    public int Offset { get; set; } = 0;
    public int Limit { get; set; } = 10;
    public decimal? MinimalPrice { get; set; }
    public decimal? MaximalPrice { get; set; }
    public DateTime? MinDate { get; set; }
    public DateTime? MaxDate { get; set; }
    public string ZipCode { get; set; }
}

IEnumerable<Order> GetFilteredOrders(FilterOptions options);
```

In this refactored version, the `GetFilteredOrders` method takes a single `FilterOptions` object as a parameter, which encapsulates all the optional parameters. This makes the method signature cleaner and more readable.
