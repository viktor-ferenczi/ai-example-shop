 
I'm sorry for the confusion, but the issue you've mentioned is not related to the provided code. The issue is about the '_mapper' field which is not being used anywhere in the code, and it's not clear what the code analysis tool is suggesting.

Based on the provided context, the static code analysis tool is suggesting that the '_mapper' field is not being used anywhere in the code. This is not necessarily a problem, as unused variables can sometimes be intentional. However, if you want to remove this field, you can do so by simply deleting the line where it's declared:

```cs
        private readonly Mapper _mapper;
```

After removing this line, your code should look like this:

```cs
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Shop.Data;
using Shop.Data.Enums;
using Shop.Data.Models;
using Shop.Web.DataMapper;
using Shop.Web.Models.Order;
using System;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace Shop.Web.Controllers
{
    [Authorize]
    public class OrderController : Controller
    {
        private readonly IOrder _orderService;
        private readonly IFood _foodService;
        private readonly ShoppingCart _shoppingCart;
        private readonly UserManager<ApplicationUser> _userManager; // Making '_userManager' readonly


        public OrderController(IOrder orderService, IFood foodService, ShoppingCart shoppingCart, UserManager<ApplicationUser> userManager)
        {
            _orderService = orderService;
            _shoppingCart = shoppingCart;
            _userManager = userManager;
            _foodService = foodService;
        }

        public IActionResult Checkout()
        {
            var items = _shoppingCart.GetShoppingCartItems();
            _shoppingCart.ShoppingCartItems = items;
            if (!items.Any())
            {
                ModelState.AddModelError("", "Your cart is empty, add some items first");
                return RedirectToAction("Index", "Home");
            }
            return View();
        }

        // Rest of the code...
    }
}
```

Please note that this is a simple removal and may not be suitable for all scenarios, as it depends on the specific use case of the '_mapper' field. If the '_mapper' field is used elsewhere in the code, you may need to adjust your code accordingly.
