 

1. The plan for resolving the issue is as follows:

   - First, we need to understand the current architecture of the service. The service currently exposes the entire DbContext, which means that it can access and manipulate all data in the database. This is not a good practice as it can lead to security issues and unnecessary complexity.
   
   - Instead, we should create specific repositories for each use-case. These repositories will be responsible for interacting with the database and providing the necessary data to the service.
   
   - We will need to create an interface for each repository and implement it in a concrete class.
   
   - We will then modify the service to use these repositories instead of directly accessing the DbContext.

2. The code changes are as follows:

```cs
// TOP-MARKER
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using Shop.Data;
using Shop.Data.Models;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;

namespace Shop.Service
{
    public class FoodService : IFood
    {
        private readonly IFoodRepository _foodRepository;

        public FoodService(IFoodRepository foodRepository)
        {
            _foodRepository = foodRepository;
        }

        //... rest of the code remains the same
    }
}
```
