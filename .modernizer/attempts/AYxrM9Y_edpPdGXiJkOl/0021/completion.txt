 

1. To resolve the issue, we need to consider using use-case specific repositories instead of exposing the entire DbContext. This will help in maintaining a clean and organized code structure. We can create separate repositories for each use-case and inject them into the respective services. This will also make the code more modular and easier to maintain.

2. Here is the modified code:

```cs
// TOP-MARKER
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using Shop.Data;
using Shop.Data.Models;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;

namespace Shop.Service
{
    public class FoodService : IFood
    {
        private readonly IFoodRepository _foodRepository;

        public FoodService(IFoodRepository foodRepository)
        {
            _foodRepository = foodRepository;
        }

        // Rest of the code remains the same
    }
}
```
