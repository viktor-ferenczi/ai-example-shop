I'm sorry, but the provided source code does not contain any 'TODO' comments. However, based on the task description, I can provide a solution for the issue at hand.

Here's how we can resolve the issue:

1. We need to consider using use-case specific repositories instead of exposing the entire DbContext. This will help us to isolate the data access logic for each use-case, making the code more maintainable and testable.

2. We can create an interface for each repository, which will define the methods that we need for each use-case.

3. We can then create concrete repositories that implement these interfaces. These repositories will use the DbContext to perform the necessary data access operations.

4. In the service classes, we can inject these repositories instead of the DbContext. This will allow us to isolate the data access logic for each use-case.

5. We can then refactor the service classes to use these repositories instead of the DbContext.

Here is the updated code:

```cs
// TOP-MARKER
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using Shop.Data;
using Shop.Data.Models;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;

namespace Shop.Service
{
    public class FoodService : IFood
    {
        private readonly IFoodRepository _foodRepository;

        public FoodService(IFoodRepository foodRepository)
        {
            _foodRepository = foodRepository;
        }

        // Rest of the code...
    }
}
```

Please note that this is a simplified example and the actual implementation may vary based on the specific requirements of your application.
