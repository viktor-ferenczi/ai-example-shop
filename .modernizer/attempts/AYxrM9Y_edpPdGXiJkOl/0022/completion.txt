1. To resolve this issue, we need to consider using use-case specific repositories instead of exposing the entire dbcontext. This will help in maintaining a clean and modular codebase. We can create separate repositories for different use-cases and inject them into the services that need them.

2. Here is the modified code:

```cs
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using Shop.Data;
using Shop.Data.Models;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;

namespace Shop.Service
{
    public class FoodService : IFood
    {
        private readonly IFoodRepository _foodRepository;

        public FoodService(IFoodRepository foodRepository)
        {
            _foodRepository = foodRepository;
        }

        //... other methods remain the same
    }
}
```
