2. Here is the modified code:

```cs
// TOP-MARKER
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using Shop.Data;
using Shop.Data.Models;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;

namespace Shop.Service
{
    public class FoodService : IFood
    {
        private readonly IFoodRepository _foodRepository;

        public FoodService(IFoodRepository foodRepository)
        {
            _foodRepository = foodRepository;
        }

        // Other methods remain the same
    }
}
```

In the above code, we have replaced the ApplicationDbContext with an IFoodRepository. This is a good practice as it allows for better organization and maintainability of the code. The IFoodRepository would be responsible for interacting with the Food entity in the database. This way, we can isolate the Food-specific data access logic in the FoodRepository, and keep the FoodService focused on its core responsibilities.
