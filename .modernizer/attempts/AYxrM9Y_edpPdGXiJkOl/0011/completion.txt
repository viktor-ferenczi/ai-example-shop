 
The issue at hand is suggesting to consider using use-case specific repositories instead of exposing the entire dbcontext. This is a good practice as it helps in maintaining a clean and maintainable codebase.

Here's a possible solution:

```cs
// TOP-MARKER
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using Shop.Data;
using Shop.Data.Models;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;

namespace Shop.Service
{
    public class FoodService : IFood
    {
        private readonly IFoodRepository _foodRepository;

        public FoodService(IFoodRepository foodRepository)
        {
            _foodRepository = foodRepository;
        }

        //... rest of the code remains the same
    }
}
```

In the above code, we've replaced the direct use of `ApplicationDbContext` with a repository interface `IFoodRepository`. This is a common practice in ASP.NET Core applications to decouple the service layer from the data access layer.

Please note that the actual implementation of the `IFoodRepository` would depend on the specific requirements of your application.
