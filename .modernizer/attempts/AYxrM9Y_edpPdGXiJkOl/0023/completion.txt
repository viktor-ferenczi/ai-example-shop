We can create a new interface for each use-case and implement it in a separate repository. This way, we can control which parts of the DbContext are exposed to each use-case.

2. Here is the modified code:

```cs
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using Shop.Data;
using Shop.Data.Models;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;

namespace Shop.Service
{
    public class FoodService : IFood
    {
        private readonly IFoodRepository _foodRepository;

        public FoodService(IFoodRepository foodRepository)
        {
            _foodRepository = foodRepository;
        }

        //... other methods ...
    }
}
```

In this code, we are injecting an IFoodRepository into the FoodService. This repository will handle all the data access for the FoodService. This way, we can control which parts of the DbContext are exposed to the FoodService, and we can easily swap out the repository for a different implementation if needed.
