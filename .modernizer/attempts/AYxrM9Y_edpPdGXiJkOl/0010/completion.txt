1. The issue at hand is suggesting to consider using use-case specific repositories instead of exposing the entire dbcontext. This is a good practice as it can help in maintaining a clean and modular codebase.

2. Here's a possible plan to resolve the issue:
   - Create an interface for each use-case specific repository.
   - Implement these interfaces in separate classes.
   - Inject these repositories into the services that need them.
   - Update the services to use these repositories instead of the dbcontext directly.

3. Here's the modified source code:

```cs
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using Shop.Data;
using Shop.Data.Models;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;

namespace Shop.Service
{
    public class FoodService : IFood
    {
        private readonly IFoodRepository _foodRepository;

        public FoodService(IFoodRepository foodRepository)
        {
            _foodRepository = foodRepository;
        }

        // ... other methods ...
    }
}
```

4. Here are the failure conditions to check:
   - The FoodService class now depends on an IFoodRepository instead of ApplicationDbContext.
   - The FoodService class no longer directly uses the dbcontext.
   - The FoodService class still has all the methods it had before.
   - The FoodService class still has all the functionality it had before.
   - The FoodService class still works as expected.
