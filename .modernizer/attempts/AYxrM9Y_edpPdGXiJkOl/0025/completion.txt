 

1. Here's a step-by-step plan for resolving the issue:
   - First, we need to understand the current implementation of the FoodService class. It directly exposes the entire DbContext, which is not a good practice. This can lead to potential security issues and make the code harder to maintain.
   - Instead, we should consider using use-case specific repositories. This approach will allow us to encapsulate the data access logic for each use-case, making the code more modular and easier to maintain.
   - We can create an interface for each repository and its implementation. The interface will define the methods that will be used by the service, while the implementation will contain the actual logic to interact with the database.
   - The FoodService class will then depend on these interfaces instead of the DbContext. This way, we can easily swap out the repository implementation for testing purposes or to change the data access strategy.

2. Based on the plan, here's the modified source code:

```cs
// TOP-MARKER
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using Shop.Data;
using Shop.Data.Models;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;

namespace Shop.Service
{
    public class FoodService : IFood
    {
        private readonly IFoodRepository _foodRepository;

        public FoodService(IFoodRepository foodRepository)
        {
            _foodRepository = foodRepository;
        }

        // Rest of the code remains the same...
    }
}
```
