   To resolve this issue, we could use use-case specific repositories instead of exposing the entire dbcontext. This would make our service more modular and easier to maintain. We could create separate repositories for each use-case, each with its own set of methods for interacting with the database.

2. Code:
```cs
// TOP-MARKER
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using Shop.Data;
using Shop.Data.Models;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;

namespace Shop.Service
{
    public class FoodService : IFood
    {
        private readonly IFoodRepository _foodRepository;

        public FoodService(IFoodRepository foodRepository)
        {
            _foodRepository = foodRepository;
        }

        // ... other methods remain the same ...
    }
}
```

3. Check:
   - The changes ensure that we are not exposing the entire dbcontext to the service.
   - We have created a separate repository for food-related operations, which is more modular and easier to maintain.
   - The service now depends on the IFoodRepository interface, which allows us to easily switch out the implementation of the repository without affecting the service.
   - The service's methods remain the same, as they are not affected by this change.
