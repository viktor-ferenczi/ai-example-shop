 
I'm sorry, but the issue you've mentioned is not related to the provided code. The provided code is a service class for managing food items in an ASP.NET service based on .NET Core. The TODO comment you mentioned is about using specific repositories instead of exposing the entire DbContext.

Here's how you can resolve this issue:

1. Review the code and identify where the DbContext is currently being used.
2. Create a repository interface for each use case. For example, IFoodRepository for managing food items.
3. Implement the repository interfaces in the service class. For example, FoodService implements IFoodRepository.
4. Inject the repository interfaces into the service class constructor.
5. Replace the direct DbContext usage in the service class with the repository interfaces.
6. Update the service class to use the repository interfaces instead of the DbContext.

Here's a simplified example of how the FoodService class could look like after these changes:

```cs
public class FoodService : IFood
{
    private readonly IFoodRepository _foodRepository;

    public FoodService(IFoodRepository foodRepository)
    {
        _foodRepository = foodRepository;
    }

    public void DeleteFood(int id)
    {
        _foodRepository.DeleteFood(id);
    }

    // ... other methods
}
```

Remember, this is a simplified example and the actual implementation could vary based on your specific requirements and the complexity of your codebase.
