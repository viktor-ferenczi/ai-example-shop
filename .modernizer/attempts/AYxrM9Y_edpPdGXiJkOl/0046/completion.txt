Here's how you can resolve the issue:

1. The current implementation of the `FoodService` class directly exposes the entire `ApplicationDbContext` to the `IFood` interface. This can lead to potential security issues and make the service tightly coupled with the database.

2. To mitigate this, we can introduce a repository pattern where each use-case has its own repository. This way, we can control which data and operations are exposed to each service.

Here's a simplified example of how you can refactor the `FoodService` to use a repository:

```cs
public class FoodService : IFood
{
    private readonly IFoodRepository _foodRepository;

    public FoodService(IFoodRepository foodRepository)
    {
        _foodRepository = foodRepository;
    }

    //... other methods omitted for brevity

    public void DeleteFood(int id)
    {
        var food = _foodRepository.GetById(id);
        if (food == null)
        {
            throw new ArgumentException($"No food found with id: {id}");
        }
        _foodRepository.Delete(food);
    }

    //... other methods omitted for brevity
}
```

In this refactored code, the `FoodService` now depends on the `IFoodRepository` interface, not the `ApplicationDbContext`. This allows us to control which data and operations are exposed to the service, and makes the service loosely coupled with the database.

Please note that this is a simplified example and in a real-world scenario, you would also need to create the `IFoodRepository` interface and its implementation.
