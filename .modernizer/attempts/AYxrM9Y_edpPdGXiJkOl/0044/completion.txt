 

1. The issue at hand is suggesting to consider using use-case specific repositories instead of exposing the entire DbContext. This would allow for better separation of concerns and make the code more maintainable.

2. To resolve this issue, we can create a new interface for each use-case and have it implement a generic repository interface. This way, we can have specific methods for each use-case.

Here's how we can modify the code:

```cs
// TOP-MARKER
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using Shop.Data;
using Shop.Data.Models;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;

namespace Shop.Service
{
    public interface IFoodRepository
    {
        void DeleteFood(int id);
        void EditFood(Food food);
        IEnumerable<Food> GetAll();
        Food GetById(int id);
        IEnumerable<Food> GetFilteredFoods(int id, string searchQuery);
        IEnumerable<Food> GetFilteredFoods(string q);
        IEnumerable<Food> GetFoodsByCategoryId(int categoryId);
        IEnumerable<Food> GetPreferred(int count);
        void NewFood(Food food);
    }

    public class FoodService : IFood
    {
        private readonly IFoodRepository _foodRepository;

        public FoodService(IFoodRepository foodRepository)
        {
            _foodRepository = foodRepository;
        }

        //... other methods remain the same
    }
}
```

APPROVE_CHANGES

In this modification, we have created a new interface `IFoodRepository` which includes all the methods that are currently in the `FoodService` class. Then, we have modified the `FoodService` class to depend on this new interface instead of directly on the DbContext. This way, we can now easily switch between different implementations of the `IFoodRepository` interface, depending on the use-case.
