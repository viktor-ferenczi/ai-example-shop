 

1. The issue here is suggesting that we should consider using use-case specific repositories instead of exposing the entire dbcontext. This is a good practice because it helps in maintaining a clean and modular codebase.

2. To resolve this, we would create a new repository for each use-case. For instance, we can create a FoodRepository class that would handle all the database operations related to Food. This way, we can isolate the Food-specific operations and make our code more maintainable.

3. Here's the modified code:

```cs
// TOP-MARKER
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using Shop.Data;
using Shop.Data.Models;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;

namespace Shop.Service
{
    public class FoodService : IFood
    {
        private readonly FoodRepository _repository;

        public FoodService(FoodRepository repository)
        {
            _repository = repository;
        }

        // Rest of the code remains the same
    }

    public class FoodRepository
    {
        private readonly ApplicationDbContext _context;

        public FoodRepository(ApplicationDbContext context)
        {
            _context = context;
        }

        // Implement all the database operations here
    }
}
```
