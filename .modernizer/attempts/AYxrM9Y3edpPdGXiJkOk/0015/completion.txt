 
1. The issue is with the `SetOrderBy` method. The issue is that the `orders` parameter is passed by value, not by reference. This means that when we try to reassign `orders` in the switch statement, it does not affect the original `orders` variable in the `GetFilteredOrders` method.

2. To resolve this issue, we need to pass `orders` by reference, not by value. In C#, we can achieve this by using the `ref` keyword.

3. Here is the modified code:

```cs
//TODO: bug local reference assigned, but not returned. Open/Closed principle violated
private void SetOrderBy(ref IEnumerable<Order> orders, OrderBy orderBy)
{
    switch (orderBy)
    {
        case OrderBy.DateDesc:
            orders = orders.OrderByDescending(order => order.OrderPlaced);
            break;
        case OrderBy.DateAsc:
            orders = orders.OrderBy(order => order.OrderPlaced);
            break;
        case OrderBy.PriceAsc:
            orders = orders.OrderBy(order => order.OrderTotal);
            break;
        case OrderBy.PriceDesc:
            orders = orders.OrderByDescending(order => order.OrderTotal);
            break;
        default: throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
}
```

4. After modifying the code, the `SetOrderBy` method should be called with the `ref` keyword:

```cs
if (orderBy != OrderBy.None)
{
    SetOrderBy(ref orders, orderBy);
}
```
