 
The issue reported is related to a method parameter which is not assigned a default value in the overridden method. This is a clear and intentional bug. The method signature is:

```cs
public IEnumerable<Order> GetFilteredOrders(
            string userId,
            OrderBy orderBy = OrderBy.None,
            int offset = 0, int limit = 10,
            decimal? minimalPrice = null,
            decimal? maximalPrice = null,
            DateTime? minDate = null,
            DateTime? maxDate = null,
            string zipCode = null)
```

The `userId` parameter is not assigned a default value, which means it's required when calling this method.

To resolve this issue, we need to add a default value to the `userId` parameter. However, since it's a required parameter, we can't simply add a default value. Instead, we need to modify the method to accept an optional `userId`.

Here's the corrected method signature:

```cs
public IEnumerable<Order> GetFilteredOrders(
            string userId = null,
            OrderBy orderBy = OrderBy.None,
            int offset = 0, int limit = 10,
            decimal? minimalPrice = null,
            decimal? maximalPrice = null,
            DateTime? minDate = null,
            DateTime? maxDate = null,
            string zipCode = null)
```

In this corrected version, `userId` is now optional and can be `null`. This means that if no `userId` is provided when calling the method, the method will return all orders. If a `userId` is provided, the method will return only the orders for that specific user.
