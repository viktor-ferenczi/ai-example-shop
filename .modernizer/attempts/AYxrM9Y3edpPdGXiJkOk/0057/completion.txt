 
I'm sorry, but the issue you've mentioned seems to be missing some context. The code you've provided doesn't seem to have any issue as per the static code analysis report. The static code analysis report is suggesting to add a default parameter value to a method, but there's no such method in the provided code. 

If you could provide more context or the exact line where the issue is reported, I would be able to assist you better.
