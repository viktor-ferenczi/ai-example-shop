 
The issue is with the method `SetOrderBy`, where the parameter `orders` is passed by value instead of by reference. This means that the `orders` variable inside the method is a local copy, and any changes made to it will not affect the original variable outside the method.

To resolve this issue, we need to pass `orders` by reference, so any changes made to it inside the method will also affect the original variable.

Here's the corrected code:

```cs
private void SetOrderBy(ref IEnumerable<Order> orders, OrderBy orderBy)
{
    switch (orderBy)
    {
        case OrderBy.DateDesc:
            orders = orders.OrderByDescending(order => order.OrderPlaced);
            break;
        case OrderBy.DateAsc:
            orders = orders.OrderBy(order => order.OrderPlaced);
            break;
        case OrderBy.PriceAsc:
            orders = orders.OrderBy(order => order.OrderTotal);
            break;
        case OrderBy.PriceDesc:
            orders = orders.OrderByDescending(order => order.OrderTotal);
            break;
        default: throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
}
```
