 
The issue is related to a method parameter not having a default value, but it's not specified which one. The method signature is:

```cs
public IEnumerable<Order> GetFilteredOrders(
            string userId,
            OrderBy orderBy = OrderBy.None,
            int offset = 0, int limit = 10,
            decimal? minimalPrice = null,
            decimal? maximalPrice = null,
            DateTime? minDate = null,
            DateTime? maxDate = null,
            string zipCode = null)
```

The issue is with the `userId` parameter. It should have a default value, but it's not specified in the original code.

To resolve this issue, you can add a default value to the `userId` parameter. Here is the modified code:

```cs
public IEnumerable<Order> GetFilteredOrders(
            string userId = null,
            OrderBy orderBy = OrderBy.None,
            int offset = 0, int limit = 10,
            decimal? minimalPrice = null,
            decimal? maximalPrice = null,
            DateTime? minDate = null,
            DateTime? maxDate = null,
            string zipCode = null)
```

In this modified code, `userId` is given a default value of `null`. This allows the method to be called without providing a `userId`, which is useful when you want to get all orders without filtering by a specific user.
