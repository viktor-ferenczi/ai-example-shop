 
The issue is related to the `SetOrderBy` method, where the `orders` parameter is being reassigned within the switch statement. This is not a bug, but rather a violation of the Open/Closed Principle. The `SetOrderBy` method should return the ordered sequence, not modify the input sequence.

Here is the corrected code:

```cs
private IEnumerable<Order> SetOrderBy(IEnumerable<Order> orders, OrderBy orderBy)
{
    switch (orderBy)
    {
        case OrderBy.DateDesc:
            return orders.OrderByDescending(order => order.OrderPlaced);
        case OrderBy.DateAsc:
            return orders.OrderBy(order => order.OrderPlaced);
        case OrderBy.PriceAsc:
            return orders.OrderBy(order => order.OrderTotal);
        case OrderBy.PriceDesc:
            return orders.OrderByDescending(order => order.OrderTotal);
        default: throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
}
```

And the usage of this method should be updated to:

```cs
orders = SetOrderBy(orders, orderBy);
```
