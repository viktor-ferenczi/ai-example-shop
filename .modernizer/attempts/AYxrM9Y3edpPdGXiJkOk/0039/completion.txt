 
I'm sorry, but the source code you provided does not contain any issues that match the description you provided. The code is well-structured, follows good practices, and does not contain any obvious bugs or issues.

However, I can provide a suggestion for improving the code. You could consider adding a default value for the `userId` parameter in the `GetByUserId` method. This would make the method more flexible and easier to use. Here's how you could modify the method:

```cs
public IEnumerable<Order> GetByUserId(string userId = null)
{
    if (userId == null)
    {
        throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(userId));
    }

    return GetAll()
        .Where(order => order.User.Id == userId);
}
```

This change ensures that if no `userId` is provided, the method will throw an `ArgumentNullException`. This is a good practice because it makes the method's behavior more predictable and easier to understand.

Please note that this is just a suggestion and the actual implementation may depend on your specific requirements and constraints.
