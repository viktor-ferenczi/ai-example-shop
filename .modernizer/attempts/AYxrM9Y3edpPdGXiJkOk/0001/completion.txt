 
I'm sorry for any confusion, but the issue you've mentioned seems to be a false positive. There's no missing parameter in the method signature, and the code provided does not contain any placeholders.

The method signature is:
```cs
public IEnumerable<Order> GetFilteredOrders(
            string userId,
            OrderBy orderBy = OrderBy.None,
            int offset = 0, int limit = 10,
            decimal? minimalPrice = null,
            decimal? maximalPrice = null,
            DateTime? minDate = null,
            DateTime? maxDate = null,
            string zipCode = null)
```

The parameter `userId` is not optional, and it's the first parameter in the method signature. There's no missing parameter in the method signature.

As for the placeholders, the code provided does not contain any placeholders.

I'm sorry for any confusion, but the issue you've mentioned seems to be a false positive.
