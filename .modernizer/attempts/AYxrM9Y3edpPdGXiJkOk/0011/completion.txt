 
The issue is related to the method `SetOrderBy` which is a private method and it's not being used anywhere in the code. This method is intended to sort the orders based on the provided `OrderBy` enum value. However, the issue is with the `SetOrderBy` method itself. The issue is that the `orders` parameter is being reassigned within the `switch` statement, but this does not affect the original `orders` variable in the calling method.

Here is the corrected code:

```cs
private IEnumerable<Order> SetOrderBy(IEnumerable<Order> orders, OrderBy orderBy)
{
    switch (orderBy)
    {
        case OrderBy.DateDesc:
            orders = orders.OrderByDescending(order => order.OrderPlaced);
            break;
        case OrderBy.DateAsc:
            orders = orders.OrderBy(order => order.OrderPlaced);
            break;
        case OrderBy.PriceAsc:
            orders = orders.OrderBy(order => order.OrderTotal);
            break;
        case OrderBy.PriceDesc:
            orders = orders.OrderByDescending(order => order.OrderTotal);
            break;
        default: throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
    return orders;
}
```

In the corrected code, the `SetOrderBy` method now returns the sorted `orders` variable, which is then used in the calling method. This way, the sorting is correctly applied to the original `orders` variable.
