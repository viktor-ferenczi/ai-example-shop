 

1. The issue is with the parameter `userId` in the `GetByUserId` method. It is not assigned a default value, which is causing the error. To resolve this, we need to assign a default value to `userId`.

2. Here is the modified code:

```cs
public IEnumerable<Order> GetByUserId(string userId = null)
{
    return GetAll()
        .Where(order => order.User.Id == userId);
}
```

3. I have made the necessary changes to the code.
