 
I'm sorry, but the issue you've described doesn't seem to be related to the provided source code. The code you've provided is a class named `OrderService` that handles orders in an ASP.NET service. The issue you've mentioned seems to be related to a parameter in a method signature, but it's not clear which method this is referring to. Could you please provide more context or clarify the issue?
