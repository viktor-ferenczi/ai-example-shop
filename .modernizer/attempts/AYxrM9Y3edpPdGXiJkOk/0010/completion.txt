 
The issue is related to the `SetOrderBy` method, which is supposed to sort orders based on the provided `OrderBy` enum value. However, the method is not correctly modifying the `orders` variable. The `orders` variable is a local reference and it is not returned from the method.

Here's the corrected code:

```cs
private IEnumerable<Order> SetOrderBy(IEnumerable<Order> orders, OrderBy orderBy)
{
    switch (orderBy)
    {
        case OrderBy.DateDesc:
            orders = orders.OrderByDescending(order => order.OrderPlaced);
            break;
        case OrderBy.DateAsc:
            orders = orders.OrderBy(order => order.OrderPlaced);
            break;
        case OrderBy.PriceAsc:
            orders = orders.OrderBy(order => order.OrderTotal);
            break;
        case OrderBy.PriceDesc:
            orders = orders.OrderByDescending(order => order.OrderTotal);
            break;
        default: throw new NotImplementedException();
    }

    return orders;
}
```

In this corrected version, the `SetOrderBy` method returns the sorted `orders` variable. This change ensures that the sorted orders are returned and can be used in subsequent operations.
