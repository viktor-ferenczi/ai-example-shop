 
I'm sorry, but the provided code does not contain any issue that needs to be resolved. The code provided seems to be a class named `OrderService` that is implementing an interface named `IOrder`. This class has several methods for creating, retrieving and filtering orders. The provided code does not contain any issue that needs to be resolved.

However, if there were a specific issue or bug in the code that needed to be resolved, I would need more information about that issue to provide a solution.
