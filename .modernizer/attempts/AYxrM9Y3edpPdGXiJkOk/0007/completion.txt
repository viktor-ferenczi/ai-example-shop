 
The issue is reported at the following code line:
```cs
            string userId,
```
This issue is related to a missing default parameter value in the method signature. The method signature should be updated to include a default value for the `userId` parameter.

Here is the corrected code:
```cs
public IEnumerable<Order> GetFilteredOrders(
    string userId = "",
    OrderBy orderBy = OrderBy.None,
    int offset = 0, int limit = 10,
    decimal? minimalPrice = null,
    decimal? maximalPrice = null,
    DateTime? minDate = null,
    DateTime? maxDate = null,
    string zipCode = null)
{
    // Rest of the method implementation
}
```
In this corrected code, an empty string `""` is used as the default value for the `userId` parameter. This ensures that the method can be called without providing a `userId`, which was the issue reported.
