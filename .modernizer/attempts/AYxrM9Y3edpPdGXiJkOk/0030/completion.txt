 
The issue is related to the `SetOrderBy` method, where the `orders` variable is being reassigned inside the switch statement. This is a common mistake in C#, but it's not a bug per se. It's a violation of the Open/Closed Principle, which states that software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

The corrected code should not reassign the `orders` variable inside the switch statement. Instead, it should create a new variable and assign the sorted orders to it.

Here is the corrected code:

```cs
private IEnumerable<Order> SetOrderBy(IEnumerable<Order> orders, OrderBy orderBy)
{
    switch (orderBy)
    {
        case OrderBy.DateDesc:
            return orders.OrderByDescending(order => order.OrderPlaced);
        case OrderBy.DateAsc:
            return orders.OrderBy(order => order.OrderPlaced);
        case OrderBy.PriceAsc:
            return orders.OrderBy(order => order.OrderTotal);
        case OrderBy.PriceDesc:
            return orders.OrderByDescending(order => order.OrderTotal);
        default: throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
}
```

In the `GetFilteredOrders` method, replace the `SetOrderBy` call with this new method:

```cs
orders = SetOrderBy(orders, orderBy);
```
