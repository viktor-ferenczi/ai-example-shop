 
The issue is reported at the line where the `userId` parameter is declared. The static code analysis tool is suggesting to add a default value for this parameter, but the original code does not provide a default value for this parameter.

Here is the corrected code:

```cs
public Order GetById(int orderId, string userId = null)
```

By adding a default value for the `userId` parameter, the static code analysis tool should no longer report the issue.
