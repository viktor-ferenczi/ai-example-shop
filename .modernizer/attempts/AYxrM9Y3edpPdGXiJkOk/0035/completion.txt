 
I'm sorry, but the code you provided does not contain any issues that require a default parameter value. The code you provided is a class definition for an OrderService in an ASP.NET service based on .NET Core. The class has a constructor that takes two parameters, an ApplicationDbContext and a ShoppingCart. These parameters are required when creating an instance of the OrderService class.

If you're referring to a different part of the code that requires a default parameter value, please provide that code so I can assist you further.
