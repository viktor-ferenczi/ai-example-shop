 
I'm sorry, but the original source code you provided does not contain the issue you mentioned. The issue is about a missing default parameter value in the `GetFilteredOrders` method. However, the method does not have any parameters that need a default value.

Here is the corrected method with the missing default parameter value:

```cs
public IEnumerable<Order> GetFilteredOrders(
    string userId,
    OrderBy orderBy = OrderBy.None,
    int offset = 0, int limit = 10,
    decimal? minimalPrice = null,
    decimal? maximalPrice = null,
    DateTime? minDate = null,
    DateTime? maxDate = null,
    string zipCode = null)
{
    // ...
}
```

Please note that this is only a correction for the issue you mentioned. If there are other issues in the code, please provide the original source code and the specific issue you want to resolve.
