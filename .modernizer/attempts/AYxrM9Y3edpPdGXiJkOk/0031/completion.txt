 
1. The issue is related to the `SetOrderBy` method, which is a private method that is used to sort the orders based on certain criteria. The issue is that the `SetOrderBy` method is not returning the sorted orders. The issue is not with the `SetOrderBy` method itself, but with the way it's called in the `GetFilteredOrders` method.

2. The `SetOrderBy` method is called with a local variable `orders`, which is a reference to the `IEnumerable<Order>` returned by the `GetAll()` method. The `SetOrderBy` method then sorts the `orders` variable, but it does not return the sorted orders. Instead, it sorts the local variable `orders`, which is then discarded when the method ends.

3. To resolve this issue, the `SetOrderBy` method should return the sorted orders instead of sorting the local variable `orders`. This can be done by changing the `SetOrderBy` method to return the sorted orders, and then assigning the returned value to the `orders` variable in the `GetFilteredOrders` method.

4. Here is the corrected code:

```cs
private IEnumerable<Order> SetOrderBy(IEnumerable<Order> orders, OrderBy orderBy)
{
    switch (orderBy)
    {
        case OrderBy.DateDesc:
            orders = orders.OrderByDescending(order => order.OrderPlaced);
            break;
        case OrderBy.DateAsc:
            orders = orders.OrderBy(order => order.OrderPlaced);
            break;
        case OrderBy.PriceAsc:
            orders = orders.OrderBy(order => order.OrderTotal);
            break;
        case OrderBy.PriceDesc:
            orders = orders.OrderByDescending(order => order.OrderTotal);
            break;
        default: throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
    return orders;
}

public IEnumerable<Order> GetFilteredOrders(
    string userId,
    OrderBy orderBy = OrderBy.None,
    int offset = 0, int limit = 10,
    decimal? minimalPrice = null,
    decimal? maximalPrice = null,
    DateTime? minDate = null,
    DateTime? maxDate = null,
    string zipCode = null)
{
    var orders = string.IsNullOrEmpty(userId) ? GetAll() : GetByUserId(userId);

    if (orderBy != OrderBy.None)
    {
        orders = SetOrderBy(orders, orderBy);
    }

    // Rest of the method...
}
```
