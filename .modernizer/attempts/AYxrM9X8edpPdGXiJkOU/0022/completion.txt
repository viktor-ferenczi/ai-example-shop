 

1. The issue is that the `roleName` variable might not always contain a valid role name. To resolve this, we should check if the `roleName` is null before trying to find a role with that name.

2. The modified source code with the resolution would look like this:

```cs
string roleId = string.IsNullOrEmpty(roleName) ? null : _roleManager.Roles.FirstOrDefault(role => role.Name == roleName).Id;
```

3. The failure conditions to check are:
   - The `roleId` variable is null if the `roleName` is null.
   - The `roleId` variable is not null if the `roleName` is not null.
   - No other changes were made to the source code.
   - The `roleId` variable is not a placeholder.

4. Since all the failure conditions are met, I would approve the changes by saying "APPROVE_CHANGES".
