 

1. The issue indicates that the role manager's Roles collection is empty or does not contain a role with the specified name. This can occur if the role has not been created yet, or if the role name is incorrect.

2. To resolve this issue, we need to ensure that the role exists before we attempt to retrieve it. We can do this by adding a check to see if the role exists before attempting to retrieve it. If the role does not exist, we can create it.

3. Here is the modified code:

```cs
string roleId;
var role = _roleManager.Roles.FirstOrDefault(role => role.Name == roleName);
if (role == null)
{
    await _roleManager.CreateAsync(new IdentityRole(roleName));
    role = _roleManager.Roles.First(role => role.Name == roleName);
}
roleId = role.Id;
```

4. After making these changes, the code should function correctly, even if the role does not exist. It will create the role if it does not exist, and then retrieve the role's ID.
