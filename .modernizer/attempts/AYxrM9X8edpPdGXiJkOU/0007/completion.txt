 
1. The problem is that the `FirstOrDefault` method is returning null when it is not supposed to. This can occur if no role with the given name exists. To resolve this, we need to add a null check before accessing the `Id` property.

2. Here is the modified source code:

```cs
string roleId = _roleManager.Roles.FirstOrDefault(role => role.Name == roleName)?.Id;
```

3. The failure conditions to check are:
   - The code change does not resolve the issue.
   - The code change introduces any related changes humans would expect to be part as your issue resolution.
   - The code change makes any changes, additions or removals to code, data or comments not related to the issue.
   - The code change replaces any part of the source code with a placeholder.

4. The modified code does not introduce any related changes humans would expect to be part as your issue resolution. It only modifies the code related to the issue. It does not make any changes, additions or removals to code, data or comments not related to the issue. The code does not replace any part of the source code with a placeholder. Therefore, I approve the code changes.
