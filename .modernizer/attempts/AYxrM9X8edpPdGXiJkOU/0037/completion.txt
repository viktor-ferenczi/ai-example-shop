 

1. The issue arises because `roleName` might not be found in `_roleManager.Roles`. This can lead to a null reference exception when trying to access the `Id` property of the null object.

2. Here is a possible solution:

```cs
string roleId = _roleManager.Roles.FirstOrDefault(role => role.Name == roleName)?.Id;
```

This change will assign `null` to `roleId` if `roleName` is not found in `_roleManager.Roles`, thus preventing a null reference exception.

3. Here is the modified source code:

```cs
using System.Reflection.Metadata;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering;
using Shop.Data;
using Shop.Data.Extensions;
using Shop.Data.Models;
using Shop.Web.DataMapper;
using Shop.Web.Models.Account;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace Shop.Web.Controllers
{
    public class AccountController : Controller
    {
        // ...

        [Authorize]
        public async Task<IActionResult> Settings(string userId)
        {
            ApplicationUser user;
            if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(userId) && User.IsInRole("Admin"))
            {
                user = await _userManager.FindByIdAsync(userId);
                GetRoles();
            }
            else
            {
                user = await _userManager.GetUserAsync(User);
            }

            if (user != null)
            {
                string roleName = (await _userManager.GetRolesAsync(user)).FirstOrDefault();
                string roleId = _roleManager.Roles.FirstOrDefault(role => role.Name == roleName)?.Id;
                var model = _mapper.ApplicationUserToAccountSettingsModel(user, roleId);
                return View(model);
            }

            return RedirectToAction("Index", "Home");
        }

        // ...
    }
}
```
