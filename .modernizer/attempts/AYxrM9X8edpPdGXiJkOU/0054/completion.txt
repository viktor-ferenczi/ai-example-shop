 
1. Plan:
   The issue is raised because the `FirstOrDefault` method is being used to find a role by name. If no role with the specified name exists, it will return null. To resolve this issue, we need to ensure that a role with the specified name always exists before we attempt to find it.

2. Code:
```cs
string roleId = _roleManager.Roles.FirstOrDefault(role => role.Name == roleName)?.Id;
```
This code will return null if no role with the specified name exists, preventing the potential null reference exception that would occur if we tried to access the `Id` property of a null object.

3. Failure conditions:
   - The code should not fail to fully resolve the issue, as it is a simple fix.
   - The code should not introduce any new issues or functionality.
   - The code should not modify any code, data or comments unrelated to the issue.
   - The code should not replace any placeholder.
   - The code should not introduce any performance or security issues.
   - The code should not change comments or string literals unrelated to your task.
   - The code should not break the code's intended functionality.
