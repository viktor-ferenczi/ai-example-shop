 
1. The issue is raised because the `_roleManager.Roles.FirstOrDefault(role => role.Name == roleName)` might return null if there is no role with the given name. To resolve this, we can add a null check before accessing the Id property.

2. Here is the modified code:
```cs
                string roleId = _roleManager.Roles.FirstOrDefault(role => role.Name == roleName)?.Id;
```
