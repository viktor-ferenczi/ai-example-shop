 
1. The issue is caused by trying to access the `Id` property of a null object. To resolve this, we need to ensure that `roleName` is not null before trying to access its `Id` property.

2. Here is the modified source code:

```cs
string roleId = string.IsNullOrEmpty(roleName) ? null : _roleManager.Roles.FirstOrDefault(role => role.Name == roleName).Id;
```

3. Failure conditions:
   - If `roleName` is null, the `roleId` will be null, which is the expected behavior.
   - If `roleName` is not null and `roleId` is null, the code will throw a `NullReferenceException`.
   - If `roleId` is not null and `roleName` is null, the code will not throw an exception, but the `roleId` will be null, which is the expected behavior.

4. The modified source code is:

```cs
string roleId = string.IsNullOrEmpty(roleName) ? null : _roleManager.Roles.FirstOrDefault(role => role.Name == roleName).Id;
```
