 

1. The issue is that the `FirstOrDefault` method is being used to find a role by its name. If no role with the specified name exists, it will return null, which will cause a null reference exception when trying to access the `Id` property of the null object.

2. Here is the modified source code:

```cs
string roleId = _roleManager.Roles.FirstOrDefault(role => role.Name == roleName)?.Id;
```

In this code, the null-conditional operator (`?.`) is used to check if the `FirstOrDefault` method returned null before trying to access the `Id` property. If the `FirstOrDefault` method returned null, the `Id` property access is skipped and `roleId` is set to null.
