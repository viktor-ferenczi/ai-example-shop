 

1. The plan for resolving the issue is as follows:
   - Check if the role exists before trying to get its ID.
   - If the role does not exist, handle the situation gracefully.

2. The roleName variable is obtained from the user's roles, so it is not null. The issue arises when trying to find a role with that name.

3. Here is the modified source code:

```cs
                var role = _roleManager.Roles.FirstOrDefault(role => role.Name == roleName);
                if (role == null)
                {
                    // Handle the situation gracefully
                    // For example, log the error or display a message to the user
                    return RedirectToAction("Index", "Home");
                }
                string roleId = role.Id;
```

4. The changes I made are compatible with all existing functionality. The roleName variable is obtained from the user's roles, so it is not null. The issue arises when trying to find a role with that name. The check for null before trying to get the role's ID ensures that the code does not throw a NullReferenceException. If the role does not exist, the code handles the situation gracefully by redirecting the user to the home page.
