 

1. The issue is caused by the `FirstOrDefault` method returning null when no matching role is found. To resolve this, we can add a null check before accessing the `Id` property.

2. Here is the modified code:

```cs
string roleId = _roleManager.Roles.FirstOrDefault(role => role.Name == roleName)?.Id;
```

3. The modified code checks if `FirstOrDefault` returns null before attempting to access the `Id` property. This prevents a `NullReferenceException` from being thrown when the role does not exist.
