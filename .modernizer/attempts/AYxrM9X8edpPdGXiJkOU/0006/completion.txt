1. The issue is due to the possibility that there might not be a role with the name `roleName`. This can be resolved by adding a null check before accessing the `Id` property.

2. Here is the modified source code:

```cs
string roleId = _roleManager.Roles.FirstOrDefault(role => role.Name == roleName)?.Id;
```

I have added a null check before accessing the `Id` property. This will ensure that the code does not throw a NullReferenceException if the `FirstOrDefault` method returns null.
