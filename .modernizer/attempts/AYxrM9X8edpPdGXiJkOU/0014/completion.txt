 
1. The issue is that the `FirstOrDefault` method is being called on a collection that may not contain any elements. This could lead to a `NullReferenceException` if the collection is empty.

2. Here is the modified code:

```cs
string roleId = "";
var role = _roleManager.Roles.FirstOrDefault(role => role.Name == roleName);
if (role != null)
{
    roleId = role.Id;
}
```

In this code, I first check if the `FirstOrDefault` method returned a non-null value. If it did, I assign the `Id` of that role to `roleId`. If it didn't, I leave `roleId` as an empty string.

```cs
                string roleId = "";
                var role = _roleManager.Roles.FirstOrDefault(role => role.Name == roleName);
                if (role != null)
                {
                    roleId = role.Id;
                }
```
