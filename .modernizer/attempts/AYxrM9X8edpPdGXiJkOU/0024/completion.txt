1. The problem is that the `FirstOrDefault` method is returning null when it's not supposed to. This is because there is no role with the name `roleName`. We need to handle this scenario.

2. Here is the modified source code:

```cs
                string roleId = _roleManager.Roles.FirstOrDefault(role => role.Name == roleName)?.Id;
                if (roleId == null)
                {
                    // Handle the scenario when there is no role with the given name
                    // This could be done by throwing an exception, logging the error, or returning a default value
                    // For now, we'll just return an empty string
                    roleId = "";
                }
```

3. Failure conditions:
   - If `roleName` is not a valid role name, `roleId` will be null.
   - If `roleName` is a valid role name, but there is no role with that name, `roleId` will be null.
