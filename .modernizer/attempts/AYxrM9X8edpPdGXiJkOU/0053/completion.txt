 

1. The issue is that the `FirstOrDefault` method is being used to find a role by name, but if no role with the given name exists, it will return `null`. This can cause a `NullReferenceException` when trying to access the `Id` property of the `null` object.

2. To resolve this issue, we can add a null check before accessing the `Id` property. If the role is `null`, we can return an error message or handle it in another way that makes sense in the context of our application.

3. Here is the modified code:

```cs
string roleId = _roleManager.Roles.FirstOrDefault(role => role.Name == roleName)?.Id;
```

4. The failure conditions to check are:
   - The code still throws a `NullReferenceException` when trying to access the `Id` property of a `null` role.
   - The code still tries to access the `Id` property of a `null` role without checking if it's `null` first.
   - The code still tries to access the `Id` property of a `null` role, but the error is not properly handled.
   
If all these conditions are not met, then the changes are approved. Otherwise, provide a concise explanation why.
