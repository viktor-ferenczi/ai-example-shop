 
1. The issue arises because the `FirstOrDefault` method is being used to find a role in the `_roleManager.Roles` collection. If no role with the specified name exists, `FirstOrDefault` returns `null`. This can lead to a `NullReferenceException` when trying to access the `Id` property of `null`.

2. To resolve this issue, we can add a null check before accessing the `Id` property. If the role is null, we can return a default value or handle the error in a different way that is appropriate for our application.

3. Here is the modified code:

```cs
string roleId = _roleManager.Roles.FirstOrDefault(role => role.Name == roleName)?.Id;
```

4. The modified code checks if `role` is `null` before trying to access its `Id` property. If `role` is `null`, the `Id` property access is skipped and `roleId` is assigned `null`.

```cs
string roleId = _roleManager.Roles.FirstOrDefault(role => role.Name == roleName)?.Id;
```
