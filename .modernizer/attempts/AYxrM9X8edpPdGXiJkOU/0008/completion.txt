 
I'm sorry for the confusion, but the issue you've mentioned is a logical error, not a syntax error or a runtime error. The problem is that the `FirstOrDefault` method is being used to find a role by name, but if no role with the given name exists, it will return `null`. This will cause a `NullReferenceException` when trying to access the `Id` property of a `null` object.

Here's a possible solution:

```cs
string roleId = _roleManager.Roles.FirstOrDefault(role => role.Name == roleName)?.Id;
```

In this updated code, the `?` operator is used to check if the `FirstOrDefault` method returned `null` before trying to access the `Id` property. If `FirstOrDefault` returns `null`, the `?` operator will prevent the `NullReferenceException` from being thrown and the `Id` property will not be accessed. Instead, `roleId` will be `null`.

Please note that this solution assumes that `roleName` is always a valid role name. If `roleName` could be an invalid role name, you should add error handling to ensure that `role` is not `null` before trying to access its `Id` property.
