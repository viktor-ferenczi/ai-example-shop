 
1. The issue is that the `FirstOrDefault()` method is being used to find a role by name. If no role with the specified name exists, it will return `null`. This can cause a `NullReferenceException` when trying to access the `Id` property of the `null` role.

2. Here's a proposed solution:

```cs
string roleId = _roleManager.Roles.FirstOrDefault(role => role.Name == roleName)?.Id;
```

This change uses the null-conditional operator (`?.`) to check if the role is `null` before trying to access its `Id` property. If the role is `null`, it will return `null` instead of throwing a `NullReferenceException`.
