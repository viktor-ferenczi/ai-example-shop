I'm sorry, but the issue you've mentioned is not directly related to the provided source code. The code you've provided does not contain any issues related to the `_roleManager.Roles.FirstOrDefault(role => role.Name == roleName)` line. The issue you've mentioned is about the possibility that the `roleName` could be null, which would result in a null reference exception when trying to access the `Id` property of the returned role.

To resolve this issue, you can add a null check before accessing the `Id` property. Here's how you can modify the code:

```cs
string roleId = _roleManager.Roles.FirstOrDefault(role => role.Name == roleName)?.Id;
```

This change will ensure that the `Id` property is only accessed if `roleName` is not null. If `roleName` is null, `roleId` will be null as well.

Please note that this change assumes that the `roleName` variable is not null. If it is possible for `roleName` to be null, you should add appropriate null checks or handle it in a different way to prevent null reference exceptions.

Please let me know if you need help with anything else.
