 

1. The problem is that `_roleManager.Roles.FirstOrDefault(role => role.Name == roleName)` might return null if there is no role with the specified name. To resolve this, we need to add a null check before accessing the Id property.

2. Here is the modified source code:

```cs
string roleId = _roleManager.Roles.FirstOrDefault(role => role.Name == roleName)?.Id;
```

3. The failure conditions to check are:
   - The code still fails to resolve the issue if `_roleManager.Roles.FirstOrDefault(role => role.Name == roleName)` returns null.
   - The code still fails to resolve the issue if the Id property is accessed without checking if it is null.
   - The code still fails to resolve the issue if the Id property is accessed without using the null-conditional operator (?.).
