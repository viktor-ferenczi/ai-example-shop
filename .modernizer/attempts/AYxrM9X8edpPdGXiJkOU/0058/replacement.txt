string roleId = _roleManager.Roles.FirstOrDefault(role => role.Name == roleName)?.Id;
```

In the modified code, I have added a null-conditional operator `?.`. This operator allows us to access the `Id` property of a `null` object, which in this case, would prevent a `NullReferenceException` from being thrown.
