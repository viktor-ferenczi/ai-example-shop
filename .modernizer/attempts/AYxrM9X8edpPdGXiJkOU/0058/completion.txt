 

1. The issue arises because the `FirstOrDefault()` method is being used to find a role by name, but if no role with the specified name exists, it will return `null`. This can lead to a `NullReferenceException` if we try to access the `Id` property of a `null` object.

2. Here is the modified source code:

```cs
                string roleId = _roleManager.Roles.FirstOrDefault(role => role.Name == roleName)?.Id;
```

In the modified code, I have added a null-conditional operator `?.`. This operator allows us to access the `Id` property of a `null` object, which in this case, would prevent a `NullReferenceException` from being thrown.

```cs
                string roleId = _roleManager.Roles.FirstOrDefault(role => role.Name == roleName)?.Id;
```
