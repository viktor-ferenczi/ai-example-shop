 

1. The issue arises because the `_roleManager.Roles.FirstOrDefault(role => role.Name == roleName)` might return null if there is no role with the name `roleName`. This can occur if the role is not found in the `_roleManager.Roles` collection.

2. To resolve this issue, we can add a null check before accessing the `Id` property of the role. If the role is null, we can return an error message or handle it in another way that best suits our needs.

3. Here is the modified source code:

```cs
string roleId;
var role = _roleManager.Roles.FirstOrDefault(role => role.Name == roleName);
if (role != null)
{
    roleId = role.Id;
}
else
{
    // Handle the case when the role is not found
    // For example, throw an exception or return a default value
    throw new Exception($"Role with name {roleName} not found");
}
```

4. Check these failure conditions by reviewing the changes your made to the source code:
   - The changes I made fully resolve the issue because they add a null check before accessing the `Id` property of the role.
   - I have not missed any related changes humans would expect to be part as my issue resolution.
   - I have not made any changes, additions or removals to code, data or comments not related to the issue.
   - I have not replaced any part of the source code with a placeholder.
