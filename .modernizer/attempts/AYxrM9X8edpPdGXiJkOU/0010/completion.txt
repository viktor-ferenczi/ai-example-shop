1. The issue is that the `FirstOrDefault` method is being used to find a role by name, but if the role does not exist, it will return null. This can cause a null reference exception when trying to access the Id property of the role.

2. Here is the modified code:

```cs
string roleId = _roleManager.Roles.FirstOrDefault(role => role.Name == roleName)?.Id;
```

The `?` operator is used to check if the result of `FirstOrDefault` is null before trying to access its Id property. If the role does not exist, `roleId` will be null.

```cs
string roleId = _roleManager.Roles.FirstOrDefault(role => role.Name == roleName)?.Id;
```
