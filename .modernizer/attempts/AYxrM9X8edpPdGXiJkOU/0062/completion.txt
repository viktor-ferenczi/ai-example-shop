 

1. The issue is that the `FirstOrDefault` method is returning null when there is no role with the specified name. This can happen if the role name is incorrect or if there are no roles in the `_roleManager.Roles` collection.

   To resolve this, we can add a null check before accessing the `Id` property of the role. If the role is null, we can return a default value or handle the error in a way that makes sense for our application.

2. Here is the modified code:

```cs
string roleId = _roleManager.Roles.FirstOrDefault(role => role.Name == roleName)?.Id;
```

3. Failure conditions:
   - The code changes are not fully resolving the issue.
   - There are changes made to the code, data or comments not related to the issue.
   - The code is replaced by a placeholder.

4. Here is the modified source code:

```cs
string roleId = _roleManager.Roles.FirstOrDefault(role => role.Name == roleName)?.Id;
var roles = _roleManager.Roles.Select(role => new RoleDropdownModel
{
    Id = role.Id,
    Name = role.Name
});
ViewBag.Roles = new SelectList(roles, "Id", "Name");
```
