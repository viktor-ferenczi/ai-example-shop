 
1. The issue is that `_roleManager.Roles.FirstOrDefault(role => role.Name == roleName)` could potentially return null if there is no role with the name `roleName`. This would cause a NullReferenceException when trying to access the `Id` property of the role.

2. To resolve this issue, we should add a null check before trying to access the `Id` property. If the role is null, we can handle this situation in a way that makes sense for our application. For example, we could return a default role or throw an exception.

3. Here is the modified code:

```cs
string roleId = _roleManager.Roles.FirstOrDefault(role => role.Name == roleName)?.Id;
```

4. The failure conditions to check are:
   - The roleId is still null after the null check.
   - The code still throws a NullReferenceException when trying to access the Id property of the role.
   - The code still tries to access the Id property of a null role.
   - The code still tries to access the Id property of a role that does not exist.
