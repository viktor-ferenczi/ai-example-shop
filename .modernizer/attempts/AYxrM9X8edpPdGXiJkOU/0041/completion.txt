 
1. Plan: 
   - The issue is occurring because the `FirstOrDefault` method is being called on `_roleManager.Roles`, which is a collection of roles. If there is no role with the name `roleName`, `FirstOrDefault` will return null.
   - To resolve this issue, we can add a null check before accessing the `Id` property of the role. If the role is null, we can handle this situation appropriately, such as by returning a default value or throwing an exception.

2. Code:
```cs
string roleId = _roleManager.Roles.FirstOrDefault(role => role.Name == roleName)?.Id;
```
The null check is added by appending `?.Id` to the end of the line. If `FirstOrDefault` returns null, the `?.Id` part will not be evaluated and the `roleId` variable will be set to null.

3. Failure Conditions:
   - If `roleName` does not exist in the `_roleManager.Roles` collection, `roleId` will be null.
   - If `roleName` exists in the `_roleManager.Roles` collection, `roleId` will be the `Id` of the role with the name `roleName`.
