 
The issue is occurring because the `FirstOrDefault()` method is being called on `_roleManager.Roles`, which is a collection of roles. If there is no role with the name `roleName`, `FirstOrDefault()` will return null. This will cause a NullReferenceException when trying to access the `Id` property of the null object.

Here's a modified version of the code that checks if `role` is null before trying to access its `Id` property:

```cs
string roleId = _roleManager.Roles.FirstOrDefault(role => role.Name == roleName)?.Id;
```

In this modified version, if `role` is null, `?.Id` will return null instead of throwing an exception. This will prevent the NullReferenceException from occurring.

```cs
string roleId = _roleManager.Roles.FirstOrDefault(role => role.Name == roleName)?.Id;
```
