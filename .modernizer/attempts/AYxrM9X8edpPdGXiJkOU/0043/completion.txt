 
1. The issue arises because the `FirstOrDefault` method is being used to find a role by its name. If the role does not exist, it will return `null`, which will cause a `NullReferenceException` when trying to access the `Id` property. 

2. Here is the modified code:
```cs
string roleId = _roleManager.Roles.FirstOrDefault(role => role.Name == roleName)?.Id;
```
In this modified code, the `?` operator is used to check if the result of `FirstOrDefault` is `null` before trying to access its `Id` property. This will prevent the `NullReferenceException` from occurring.

```cs
string roleId = _roleManager.Roles.FirstOrDefault(role => role.Name == roleName)?.Id;
```
