 

1. The issue arises because `_roleManager.Roles.FirstOrDefault(role => role.Name == roleName)` is returning null. This can happen if there is no role with the name `roleName`. To resolve this, we need to check if the role exists before trying to access its Id.

2. Here is the modified code:

```cs
if (_roleManager.Roles.Any(role => role.Name == roleName))
{
    string roleId = _roleManager.Roles.First(role => role.Name == roleName).Id;
}
else
{
    // Handle the case where the role does not exist
    // This could be as simple as logging an error or throwing an exception
    // depending on the requirements of your application
    throw new InvalidOperationException($"Role with name '{roleName}' does not exist.");
}
```

3. The modified code checks if there is a role with the name `roleName` before trying to access its Id. If the role does not exist, it throws an `InvalidOperationException`.

4. Here is the modified source code:

```cs
if (_roleManager.Roles.Any(role => role.Name == roleName))
{
    string roleId = _roleManager.Roles.First(role => role.Name == roleName).Id;
    var model = _mapper.ApplicationUserToAccountSettingsModel(user, roleId);
    return View(model);
}
else
{
    throw new InvalidOperationException($"Role with name '{roleName}' does not exist.");
}
```

5. The failure conditions to check are:
   - The code does not check if the role exists before trying to access its Id.
   - The code does not handle the case where the role does not exist.
   - The code does not include the original code in the modified code block.
