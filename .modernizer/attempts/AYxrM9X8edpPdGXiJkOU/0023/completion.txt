1. Plan:
   To resolve this issue, we need to add a null check before accessing the Id property of the role object. This will ensure that we don't attempt to access a property on a null object which would result in a NullReferenceException. Here is the modified code:

```cs
string roleId = _roleManager.Roles.FirstOrDefault(role => role.Name == roleName)?.Id;
```

2. Code:
```cs
string roleId = _roleManager.Roles.FirstOrDefault(role => role.Name == roleName)?.Id;
```

3. Failure Conditions:
   - The role object is null, leading to a NullReferenceException when trying to access the Id property.
   - The role object is not null, but the role's name does not match the provided roleName.
   - The role object is not null and the role's name matches the provided roleName, but the Id property is null.
