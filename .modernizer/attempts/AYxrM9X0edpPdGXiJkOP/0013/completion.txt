I'm sorry, but the issue you've provided does not seem to be related to the provided source code. The issue is about a static field being assigned in a non-static context, which is not allowed in C#. This is a logical error, and it should be resolved by making the `_userManager` field static.

Here's the corrected code:

```cs
private static UserManager<ApplicationUser> _userManager;
```

Please let me know if you need help with anything else.
