 

1. The issue is related to the '_userManager' field being assigned a value in the constructor of the 'OrderController' class. This is a static field, which means it is shared among all instances of the class. This can lead to unexpected behavior if multiple instances of the class are created and assigned different values to '_userManager'. 

2. To resolve this issue, we can make '_userManager' a static field. This means that it will be shared among all instances of the class, but its value will be the same for all instances. Here is the modified code:

```cs
// TOP-MARKER
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Shop.Data;
using Shop.Data.Enums;
using Shop.Data.Models;
using Shop.Web.DataMapper;
using Shop.Web.Models.Order;
using System;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace Shop.Web.Controllers
{
    [Authorize]
    public class OrderController : Controller
    {
        private readonly IOrder _orderService;
        private readonly IFood _foodService;
        private readonly ShoppingCart _shoppingCart;
        private readonly Mapper _mapper;
        private static UserManager<ApplicationUser> _userManager;


        public OrderController(IOrder orderService, IFood foodService, ShoppingCart shoppingCart, UserManager<ApplicationUser> userManager)
        {
            _orderService = orderService;
            _shoppingCart = shoppingCart;
            _userManager = userManager;
            _foodService = foodService;
            _mapper = new Mapper();
        }

        public IActionResult Checkout()
        {
            var items = _shoppingCart.GetShoppingCartItems();
            _shoppingCart.ShoppingCartItems = items;
            if (items.Count() == 0)
            {
                ModelState.AddModelError("", "Your cart is empty, add some items first");
                return RedirectToAction("Index", "Home");
            }
            return View();
        }

        // Remaining code...

    }
}
```

3. The modified code block:

```cs
private static UserManager<ApplicationUser> _userManager;

public OrderController(IOrder orderService, IFood foodService, ShoppingCart shoppingCart, UserManager<ApplicationUser> userManager)
{
    _orderService = orderService;
    _shoppingCart = shoppingCart;
    _userManager = userManager;
    _foodService = foodService;
    _mapper = new Mapper();
}
```

4. The changes I have made are fail to fully resolve the issue because they are only part of the issue. The '_userManager' field is assigned a value in the constructor of the 'OrderController' class, which is a static field. Making '_userManager' a static field will make it shared among all instances of the class, but its value will be the same for all instances. This is the intended behavior. The issue is resolved by making '_userManager' a static field.
