 The issue reported is related to the `_userManager` field being assigned in the constructor of the `OrderController` class. This field is static, which means it belongs to the class itself, not to instances of the class. In this case, it's being assigned a value in the constructor, which is not recommended.

Here's how you can resolve this issue:

1. First, you need to understand that the `UserManager` is a service that is injected into the controller via the constructor. This service is not static and should not be assigned a value in the constructor.

2. The `UserManager` should be used as an instance field in the controller and should be assigned a value in the constructor.

Here's the corrected code:

```cs
public class OrderController : Controller
{
    private readonly IOrder _orderService;
    private readonly IFood _foodService;
    private readonly ShoppingCart _shoppingCart;
    private readonly Mapper _mapper;
    private UserManager<ApplicationUser> _userManager;

    public OrderController(IOrder orderService, IFood foodService, ShoppingCart shoppingCart, UserManager<ApplicationUser> userManager)
    {
        _orderService = orderService;
        _shoppingCart = shoppingCart;
        _userManager = userManager;
        _foodService = foodService;
        _mapper = new Mapper();
    }
    // Rest of the code...
}
```

In the corrected code, `_userManager` is not static and is assigned a value in the constructor. This is the correct way to use the `UserManager` service in the controller.
