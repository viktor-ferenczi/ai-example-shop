 
I'm sorry for any confusion, but the static code analysis tool you're referring to is not a part of the .NET Core framework. It's a tool provided by a third-party, and it's not clear from the context which one you're referring to. 

However, based on the code you've provided, the issue with the static field `_userManager` is that it's being assigned a value in the constructor of the `OrderController`. This is not a good practice because static fields are shared across all instances of the class, which means that if multiple instances of the `OrderController` are created, they will all share the same `_userManager` value.

To resolve this issue, you should make `_userManager` an instance field instead of a static field. This way, each instance of the `OrderController` will have its own `_userManager` value. Here's how you can modify the code:

```cs
public class OrderController : Controller
{
    private readonly IOrder _orderService;
    private readonly IFood _foodService;
    private readonly ShoppingCart _shoppingCart;
    private readonly Mapper _mapper;
    private UserManager<ApplicationUser> _userManager;

    public OrderController(IOrder orderService, IFood foodService, ShoppingCart shoppingCart, UserManager<ApplicationUser> userManager)
    {
        _orderService = orderService;
        _shoppingCart = shoppingCart;
        _userManager = userManager;
        _foodService = foodService;
        _mapper = new Mapper();
    }

    // Rest of the code...
}
```

This change will ensure that each instance of `OrderController` has its own `_userManager` value, which is what you want in this case.
