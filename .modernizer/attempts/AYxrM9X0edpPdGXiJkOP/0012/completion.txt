 

1. The issue is that the `_userManager` field is being assigned a value in the constructor of the `OrderController`. This is a static field, which means it is shared across all instances of the class. This is not a good practice because it can lead to unexpected behavior. 

2. To resolve this issue, we can make `_userManager` a static field. This will ensure that the same instance of `UserManager` is used across all instances of the `OrderController`. Here's how we can modify the code:

```cs
private static UserManager<ApplicationUser> _userManager;
```

3. After making this change, the modified source code would look like this:

```cs
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Shop.Data;
using Shop.Data.Enums;
using Shop.Data.Models;
using Shop.Web.DataMapper;
using Shop.Web.Models.Order;
using System;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace Shop.Web.Controllers
{
    [Authorize]
    public class OrderController : Controller
    {
        private readonly IOrder _orderService;
        private readonly IFood _foodService;
        private readonly ShoppingCart _shoppingCart;
        private readonly Mapper _mapper;
        private static UserManager<ApplicationUser> _userManager;


        public OrderController(IOrder orderService, IFood foodService, ShoppingCart shoppingCart, UserManager<ApplicationUser> userManager)
        {
            _orderService = orderService;
            _shoppingCart = shoppingCart;
            _userManager = userManager;
            _foodService = foodService;
            _mapper = new Mapper();
        }

        // Rest of the code...
    }
}
```
