 

1. Step-by-step plan:
   - The issue is related to the static field `_userManager`. It's being assigned a value in the constructor of the class `OrderController`. This is causing the static code analysis to flag it.
   - To resolve this issue, we can make `_userManager` a static field. This will ensure that the `UserManager` instance is shared across all instances of the `OrderController` class.
   - We can also remove the assignment of `_userManager` in the constructor of the `OrderController` class. This is because `UserManager` is already being passed as a parameter to the constructor.

2. Modified source code:
```cs
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Shop.Data;
using Shop.Data.Enums;
using Shop.Data.Models;
using Shop.Web.DataMapper;
using Shop.Web.Models.Order;
using System;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace Shop.Web.Controllers
{
    [Authorize]
    public class OrderController : Controller
    {
        private readonly IOrder _orderService;
        private readonly IFood _foodService;
        private readonly ShoppingCart _shoppingCart;
        private readonly Mapper _mapper;
        private static UserManager<ApplicationUser> _userManager;


        public OrderController(IOrder orderService, IFood foodService, ShoppingCart shoppingCart, UserManager<ApplicationUser> userManager)
        {
            _orderService = orderService;
            _shoppingCart = shoppingCart;
            _foodService = foodService;
            _mapper = new Mapper();
            _userManager = userManager;
        }

        // Rest of the code...
    }
}
```

3. Failure conditions:
   - The `_userManager` field is not static.
   - The `_userManager` field is assigned a value in the constructor of the `OrderController` class.
   - The `_userManager` field is not removed from the constructor of the `OrderController` class.
