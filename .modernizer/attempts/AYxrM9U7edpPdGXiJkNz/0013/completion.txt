 
The issue is reported at the class declaration of `DbInitializer`. The issue is that the class is public, which means it can be accessed from anywhere. However, in this case, we want to ensure that the class is only accessible within the `Shop.Data.Seeds` namespace. 

To resolve this issue, we can add the `internal` access modifier to the class declaration. This will restrict the accessibility of the class to only the `Shop.Data.Seeds` namespace.

Here is the modified code:

```cs
namespace Shop.Data.Seeds
{
    internal class DbInitializer
    {
        // Rest of the code...
    }
}
```
