 
The issue reported is about the class `DbInitializer` not having a constructor or a static keyword. This is because the class is public, but it does not have a constructor or a static keyword.

To resolve this issue, we can add a static constructor to the class. A static constructor is a special type of constructor that is called automatically to initialize the class before the first instance is created or any static members are referenced. Here is the corrected code:

```cs
public static class DbInitializer
{
    // Rest of the code...
}
```
