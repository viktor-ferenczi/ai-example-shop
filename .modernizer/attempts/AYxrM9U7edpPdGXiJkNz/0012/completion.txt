 

1. The issue reported is about the lack of a constructor or the 'static' keyword in the 'DbInitializer' class. This is because the class is not designed to be instantiated or to be used as a static class. 

2. To resolve this issue, I will add a 'protected' constructor to the 'DbInitializer' class. This will prevent the class from being instantiated and will also make it a static class. 

```cs
public class DbInitializer
{
    protected DbInitializer()
    {
    }

    // Rest of the code...
}
```
