 
I understand the issue you're facing with the class `DbInitializer`. The issue is that the class lacks a constructor or the `static` keyword, which is necessary for it to be instantiated and used. 

Here's a revised version of the class:

```cs
public static class DbInitializer
{
    public static void Seed(IApplicationBuilder applicationBuilder)
    {
        // Rest of the code remains the same
    }

    // Rest of the class remains the same
}
```

In this revised version, I've added the `static` keyword to the class declaration. This makes the class static, which means it cannot be instantiated and used like a regular class. Instead, its methods and properties can be accessed directly using the class name.
