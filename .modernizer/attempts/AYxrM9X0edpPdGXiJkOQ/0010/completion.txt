   - The issue is reported at the line where we are checking if the shopping cart is empty. The `Count()` method is being used here which is not the most efficient way to check if a collection is empty. Instead, we can use the `Any()` method, which is more efficient and more readable.

2. Here is the modified source code:

```cs
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Shop.Data;
using Shop.Data.Enums;
using Shop.Data.Models;
using Shop.Web.DataMapper;
using Shop.Web.Models.Order;
using System;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace Shop.Web.Controllers
{
    [Authorize]
    public class OrderController : Controller
    {
        // ...

        public IActionResult Checkout()
        {
            var items = _shoppingCart.GetShoppingCartItems();
            _shoppingCart.ShoppingCartItems = items;
            if (!items.Any())
            {
                ModelState.AddModelError("", "Your cart is empty, add some items first");
                return RedirectToAction("Index", "Home");
            }
            return View();
        }

        // ...
    }
}
```

3. Here are the failure conditions to check:

   - The `Count()` method is replaced with `Any()` method.
   - The `Count()` method is not used anywhere else in the code.
   - The `Count()` method is not used in any other part of the code that is not related to this issue.
   - No code is replaced by a placeholder.
   - No new code is added that is not related to this issue.
   - No code is removed that is not related to this issue.
