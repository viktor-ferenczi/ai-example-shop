 

1. The issue is raised because the `Count()` method is used to check if the `items` collection is empty. This method will iterate through the entire collection to count the number of items, which is not efficient for large collections. Instead, we can use the `Any()` method, which will stop as soon as it finds an item, making it more efficient.

2. Here is the modified code:

```cs
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Shop.Data;
using Shop.Data.Enums;
using Shop.Data.Models;
using Shop.Web.DataMapper;
using Shop.Web.Models.Order;
using System;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace Shop.Web.Controllers
{
    [Authorize]
    public class OrderController : Controller
    {
        // ...

        public IActionResult Checkout()
        {
            var items = _shoppingCart.GetShoppingCartItems();
            _shoppingCart.ShoppingCartItems = items;
            if (!items.Any())
            {
                ModelState.AddModelError("", "Your cart is empty, add some items first");
                return RedirectToAction("Index", "Home");
            }
            return View();
        }

        // ...
    }
}
```
