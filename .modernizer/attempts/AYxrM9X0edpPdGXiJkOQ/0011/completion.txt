Sure, I understand the issue. The code is checking if the shopping cart is empty by using the `Count()` method, which is not the most efficient way. It would be better to use the `Any()` method, which checks if there are any elements in the collection.

Here's the revised code:

```cs
        public IActionResult Checkout()
        {
            var items = _shoppingCart.GetShoppingCartItems();
            _shoppingCart.ShoppingCartItems = items;
            if (!items.Any())
            {
                ModelState.AddModelError("", "Your cart is empty, add some items first");
                return RedirectToAction("Index", "Home");
            }
            return View();
        }
```

I've replaced `Count() == 0` with `Any()`. This change will improve performance and readability.
