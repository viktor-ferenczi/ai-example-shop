 I'm sorry but the code you provided does not contain any method named "GetFilteredFoods". However, based on the context provided, I can see that the method "GetFilteredFoods(int id, string searchQuery)" is the one that should be renamed to "GetFilteredFoods(int id, string q)". Here is the corrected code:

```cs
        public IEnumerable<Food> GetFilteredFoods(int id, string q)
        {
            if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(q) || string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(q))
            {
                return GetFoodsByCategoryId(id);
            }

            return GetFilteredFoods(q).Where(food => food.Category.Id == id);
        }
```

Please note that this change is based on the assumption that the method "GetFilteredFoods(string searchQuery)" is intended to be renamed to "GetFilteredFoods(string q)". If this assumption is incorrect, please provide the correct method name.
