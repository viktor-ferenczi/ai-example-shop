 

1. The first step in resolving this issue is to understand the context of the code. The issue is reported at the commented out code block starting with "{". This code block is intended to add the image URLs to the foods and categories. However, it is currently commented out. To resolve this issue, we need to uncomment this code block.

2. Here is the modified source code:
