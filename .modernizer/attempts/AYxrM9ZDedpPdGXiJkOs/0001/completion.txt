 

1. Plan:
   The issue is reported at the line where an ArgumentException is thrown when a category is not found. This exception is thrown without any custom message, which may not be meaningful to the user or the developer. 

2. Code:
```cs
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using Shop.Data;
using Shop.Data.Models;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;

namespace Shop.Service
{
    public class CategoryService : ICategory
    {
        private readonly ApplicationDbContext _context;

        public CategoryService(ApplicationDbContext context)
        {
            _context = context;
        }

        public void DeleteCategory(int id)
        {
            var category = GetById(id);
            if (category == null)
            {
                throw new ArgumentException("Category not found.");
            }
            _context.Remove(category);
            _context.SaveChanges();
        }

        public void EditCategory(Category category)
        {
            _context.Update(category);
            _context.SaveChanges();
        }

        public IEnumerable<Category> GetAll()
        {
            return _context.Categories.Include(c => c.Foods);
        }

        public Category GetById(int id)
        {
            return GetAll().FirstOrDefault(category => category.Id == id);
        }

        public void NewCategory(Category category)
        {
            _context.Add(category);
            _context.SaveChanges();
        }
    }
}
