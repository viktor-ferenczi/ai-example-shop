 
I'm sorry, but the issue you've mentioned doesn't seem to be related to the provided code. The code provided is a class named `CategoryService` which is responsible for managing categories in a database context. The issue you've mentioned seems to be related to exception handling, which is not directly related to the code provided.

However, if you want to improve the exception handling in this code, you could consider using a more meaningful exception. For instance, you could throw an `InvalidOperationException` with a custom message indicating that the category was not found. Here's how you could modify the `DeleteCategory` method:

```cs
public void DeleteCategory(int id)
{
    var category = GetById(id);
    if (category == null)
    {
        throw new InvalidOperationException($"Category with ID {id} was not found.");
    }
    _context.Remove(category);
    _context.SaveChanges();
}
```

This exception would provide a more informative message to the caller, helping them understand why the operation failed.
