 
I'm sorry, but the issue reported in the code is not related to the ArgumentException. The ArgumentException is thrown when the method is called with an invalid argument. In this case, it's thrown when a category with the provided id does not exist. The issue is not about the ArgumentException itself, but about how the exception is handled.

The ArgumentException is thrown in the DeleteCategory method when a category with the provided id does not exist. The exception is caught and re-thrown without any context. This is not a good practice because it can make debugging difficult.

A better approach would be to throw a more meaningful exception, such as an ArgumentException with a custom message. This would provide more information about the error to the caller, making it easier to debug.

Here is the corrected code:

```cs
public void DeleteCategory(int id)
{
    var category = GetById(id);
    if (category == null)
    {
        throw new ArgumentException($"Category with id {id} does not exist.");
    }
    _context.Remove(category);
    _context.SaveChanges();
}
```

I hope this helps. Please let me know if you have any other questions or issues.
