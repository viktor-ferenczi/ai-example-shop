 
The issue reported is about the lack of a meaningful exception message in the `DeleteCategory` method. This is a common practice in programming to provide a more detailed error message for debugging and logging purposes.

Here is the modified code:

```cs
public void DeleteCategory(int id)
{
    var category = GetById(id);
    if (category == null)
    {
        throw new ArgumentException($"Category with id {id} does not exist.");
    }
    _context.Remove(category);
    _context.SaveChanges();
}
```

In this code, if a category with the provided id does not exist, an `ArgumentException` is thrown with a meaningful error message. This message can help identify and debug the issue more easily.
