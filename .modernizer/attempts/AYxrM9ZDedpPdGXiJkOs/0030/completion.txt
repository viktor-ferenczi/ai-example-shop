 
The issue at hand is related to the exception message in the `DeleteCategory` method. The current exception message is not descriptive enough, which can be confusing for developers debugging the code. 

Here's a revised version of the `DeleteCategory` method with a more descriptive exception message:

```cs
public void DeleteCategory(int id)
{
    var category = GetById(id);
    if (category == null)
    {
        throw new ArgumentException($"Category with ID {id} does not exist.");
    }
    _context.Remove(category);
    _context.SaveChanges();
}
```

In this revised version, the exception message includes the ID of the category that was attempted to be deleted. This provides a clearer indication of what went wrong, making it easier to debug the issue.
