 
The issue reported is related to the exception handling in the `DeleteCategory` method. When the category is not found, an `ArgumentException` is thrown without a meaningful message. This can make it difficult for the caller to understand why an exception was thrown.

Here is the modified code:

```cs
public void DeleteCategory(int id)
{
    var category = GetById(id);
    if (category == null)
    {
        throw new ArgumentException($"Category with id {id} not found.");
    }
    _context.Remove(category);
    _context.SaveChanges();
}
```

In this code, an `ArgumentException` is thrown with a meaningful message indicating that the category with the specified id was not found. This makes it easier for the caller to understand why an exception was thrown.

    }
    _context.Remove(category);
    _context.SaveChanges();
}
```
