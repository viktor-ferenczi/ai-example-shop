 
The issue reported is about the exception message in the `DeleteCategory` method. The exception message is not descriptive enough, which can make it difficult for other developers to understand what went wrong when this exception is thrown.

Here is the modified code:

```cs
public void DeleteCategory(int id)
{
    var category = GetById(id);
    if (category == null)
    {
        throw new ArgumentException($"The category with id {id} does not exist.");
    }
    _context.Remove(category);
    _context.SaveChanges();
}
```

In this code, I have added a descriptive message to the `ArgumentException`. This message will provide a clear indication of what went wrong when the exception is thrown.
