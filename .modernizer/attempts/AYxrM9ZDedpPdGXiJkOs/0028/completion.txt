 
The issue you're referring to is related to the exception message in the `DeleteCategory` method. When an exception is thrown, it's often useful to provide a meaningful message to help diagnose the issue. Here's how you can modify the `DeleteCategory` method to include a custom exception message:

```cs
public void DeleteCategory(int id)
{
    var category = GetById(id);
    if (category == null)
    {
        throw new ArgumentException($"Category with id {id} does not exist.");
    }
    _context.Remove(category);
    _context.SaveChanges();
}
```

In this modified version, if the category with the given id does not exist, an `ArgumentException` is thrown with a custom message indicating that the category does not exist. This can help with debugging and understanding the issue.
