 
The issue reported is related to the exception message in the `DeleteCategory` method. When an exception is thrown, it's often a good practice to provide a meaningful message that describes the error. This can help with debugging and understanding the context of the error.

Here's the modified version of the `DeleteCategory` method:

```cs
public void DeleteCategory(int id)
{
    var category = GetById(id);
    if (category == null)
    {
        throw new ArgumentException($"Category with id {id} does not exist.");
    }
    _context.Remove(category);
    _context.SaveChanges();
}
```

In this modification, I added a custom message to the `ArgumentException`. It includes the id of the category that was not found, which can help identify the issue more easily.

    }
