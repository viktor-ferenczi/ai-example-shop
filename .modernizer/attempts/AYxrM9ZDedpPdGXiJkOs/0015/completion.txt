 
The issue reported is about the lack of a meaningful exception message in the `DeleteCategory` method. The `ArgumentException` being thrown does not provide any information about the reason for the exception, which can be misleading and confusing for the caller.

Here's how we can resolve this issue:

```cs
public void DeleteCategory(int id)
{
    var category = GetById(id);
    if (category == null)
    {
        throw new ArgumentException($"Category with id {id} does not exist.");
    }
    _context.Remove(category);
    _context.SaveChanges();
}
```

In this modified code, we're throwing an `ArgumentException` with a custom error message. This message will provide more context about what went wrong, which can help in debugging and understanding the issue.
