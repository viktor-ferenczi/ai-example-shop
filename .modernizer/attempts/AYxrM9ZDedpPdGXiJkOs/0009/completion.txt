 
Based on the issue reported, it seems like the `ArgumentException` is thrown without any specific message. This can make it difficult for the caller to understand what went wrong. Here's a revised version of the `DeleteCategory` method that includes a more meaningful exception message:

```cs
public void DeleteCategory(int id)
{
    var category = GetById(id);
    if (category == null)
    {
        throw new ArgumentException($"Category with id {id} does not exist.");
    }
    _context.Remove(category);
    _context.SaveChanges();
}
```

In this revised version, the `ArgumentException` is thrown with a message that includes the id of the category that was not found. This makes it easier for the caller to understand what went wrong.
