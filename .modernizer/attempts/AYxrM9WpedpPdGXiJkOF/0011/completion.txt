I'm sorry, but the code you provided does not contain any issue that matches the description provided. The code is a Razor view for an ASP.NET Core application, which is used to display a shopping cart. The code includes a table with a description, which is a good practice for accessibility and usability. 

However, if you want to add a description to the table, you can do so by adding a `<caption>` tag within the `<table>` tag. Here's how you can do it:

```cshtml
<table class="table table-hover table-dark table-stripped table-bordered">
    <caption>Description of the table</caption>
    <thead>
        <!-- Rest of the code -->
    </thead>
</table>
```

Remember to replace "Description of the table" with the actual description you want to add.
