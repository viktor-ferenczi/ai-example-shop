 
The issue is about adding a description to the table. However, the original source code already includes a description in the `<h2>` tag. 

```cshtml
<div style="background-color:rgba(248,248,248,0.6);">
    <h2 >Your shopping cart 
        <br/>Here are the products in your shopping cart.</h2>
</div>
```

This description is clear and concise, and it provides context for the table. It's not necessary to add another description in the `<table>` tag.

If you still want to add a description, you can add a `<caption>` tag within the `<table>` tag. Here's how you can do it:

```cshtml
<table class="table table-hover table-dark table-stripped table-bordered">
    <caption>Here are the products in your shopping cart.</caption>
    <!-- Rest of the table code -->
</table>
```

This will add a description to the table, and it will be displayed above the table.
