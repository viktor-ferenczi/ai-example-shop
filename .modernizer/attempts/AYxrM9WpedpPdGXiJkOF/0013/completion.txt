 
To address the issue of missing description for the table, you can add a `<caption>` tag within the `<table>` element. This tag is used to provide a description for the table. Here's how you can modify the code:

```cshtml
<table class="table table-hover table-dark table-stripped table-bordered">
    <caption>Description of the table</caption>
    <thead>
        <!-- Rest of the code -->
    </thead>
    <!-- Rest of the code -->
</table>
```

Please replace `"Description of the table"` with the actual description you want to provide.
