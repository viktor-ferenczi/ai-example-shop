Sure, let's start by understanding the issue. The static code analysis tool is pointing out that the table in the code does not have a description. This could be confusing for users who are not familiar with the table's purpose.

Here's a step-by-step plan for resolving the issue:

1. Add a `<caption>` tag inside the `<table>` tag. The `<caption>` tag is used to provide a description for a table.
2. The description should be clear and concise, explaining what the table is about.

Here's the modified code:

```cshtml
<table class="table table-hover table-dark table-stripped table-bordered">
    <caption>List of products in the shopping cart</caption>
    <thead>
        <!-- rest of the code remains the same -->
    </thead>
</table>
```

In the modified code, I've added a `<caption>` tag inside the `<table>` tag. The description inside the `<caption>` tag explains what the table is about.
