Sure, here's how you can resolve the issue:

1. The issue is about adding "<th>" headers to the "<table>" element. This is because table headers provide context to the data in the table.

2. Here's the plan to resolve the issue:
   - Identify the "<table>" element.
   - Add "<th>" elements inside the "<tr>" element that contains the headers.

3. Here's the modified source code:

```cshtml
<div class="container body-content">
    <div class="row frontPageSplash">
        <div class="col-md-6 frontPageLearn">
            <div class="frontPageHeading">Healthy, Cheap, Easy...</div>
            <p class="frontPageSubHeading">This is online shopping site for food</p>
            <div>
                <form asp-controller="Home" asp-action="Search" method="post">
                    <input asp-for="SearchQuery" type="text" class="homeSearch" placeholder="Search..." />
                </form>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="row frontPageContent">
        <h3 id="latestFoods">Prefered products</h3>
        <table class="table table-hover" id="latestFoodsTable" summary="This table contains a list of the latest foods available for purchase.">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Food Summary</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                @foreach (var food in Model.FoodsList)
                {
                    <tr>
                        <td>
                           @Html.Partial("FoodSummary", food) 
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                }
            </tbody>
        </table>
    </div>
</div>
```

4. Check the failure conditions:
   - The changes have fully resolved the issue because now the table has headers.
   - No additional changes were made that were not part of the original issue.
   - No code, data or comments were modified or removed that were not related to the issue.
   - No placeholders were used.
