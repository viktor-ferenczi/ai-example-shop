 

1. The issue is about adding "<th>" headers to the table. Here's a step-by-step plan:
   - Add a "<th>" element in the "<tr>" tag where the "<th>" element would be located.
   - Add the appropriate text for each "<th>" element to represent the column headers.

2. Here's the modified source code:

```cshtml
<table class="table table-hover table-bordered" id="categoryIndexTable">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Food</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        @foreach (var food in Model.Foods)
        {
            <tr>
                <td>
                    @Html.Partial("FoodSummary",food) 
                </td>
            </tr>
        }
    </tbody>
</table>
```
