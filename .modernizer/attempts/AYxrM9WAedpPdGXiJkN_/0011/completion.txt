Sure, let's resolve the issue.

1. The issue is about adding "<th>" headers to this "<table>". We need to add headers for each column in the table.

2. Here is the modified source code:

```cshtml
<table class="table table-hover table-bordered" id="categoryIndexTable">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Food</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        @foreach (var food in Model.Foods)
        {
            <tr>
                <td>
                   @Html.Partial("FoodSummary",food) 
                </td>
            </tr>
        }
    </tbody>
</table>
```

3. I have added a "<thead>" section with a "<tr>" row containing a "<th>" header for the "Food" column. This will serve as the header for the table.

4. I have also added the "<tbody>" section to contain the rows of the table. This is where the food items will be displayed.
