 

1. Plan:
   To add "<th>" headers to the "<table>", we need to add the following code:
   ```cshtml
   <thead>
       <tr>
           <th>Food Name</th>
           <th>Price</th>
           <th>Description</th>
           <th>Image</th>
       </tr>
   </thead>
   ```
   This code will be placed within the "<table>" tags.

2. Ignore:
   No missing information or unclear understanding of the issue.

3. Modified Source Code:
   ```cshtml
   <table class="table table-hover table-bordered" id="categoryIndexTable">
       <thead>
           <tr>
               <th>Food Name</th>
               <th>Price</th>
               <th>Description</th>
               <th>Image</th>
           </tr>
       </thead>
       <tbody>
           @foreach (var food in Model.Foods)
           {
               <tr>
                   <td>
                       @Html.Partial("FoodSummary",food) 
                   </td>
               </tr>
           }
       </tbody>
   </table>
   ```

4. Failure Conditions:
   - The changes do fully resolve the issue, as the "<th>" headers are now added to the "<table>".
   - No additional changes are required to maintain existing functionality.
   - No unrelated changes, additions or removals were made to the code, data or comments.
   - No code was replaced by a placeholder.
