Sure, let's resolve the issue.

1. Plan:
   The issue is about adding an "alt" attribute to the image. The "alt" attribute provides alternative information for an image if a user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).

2. Code:
   Here is the modified code:

```cshtml
<img src="/images/logo.png" width="140px" alt="BuyNow - Online food store">
```

3. Check:
   - The changes I made are fully resolving the issue because now the image has an "alt" attribute.
   - There are no unrelated changes made to the code.
   - The image now has an "alt" attribute which provides alternative information for the image.
   - The "alt" attribute is not a placeholder.
