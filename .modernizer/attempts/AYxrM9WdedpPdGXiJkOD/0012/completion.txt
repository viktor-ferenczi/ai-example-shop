1. To resolve the issue, we need to add an "alt" attribute to the image tag. This attribute provides alternative information for an image if a user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).

2. Here is the modified source code:

```cshtml
<img src="/images/logo.png" width="140px" alt="BuyNow - Online food store">
```

3. The failure conditions to check are:
   - The "alt" attribute is added to the image tag.
   - The "alt" attribute contains a relevant description of the image.
   - The "alt" attribute is correctly positioned after the "src" attribute.

4. The modified source code is complete and does not contain any placeholders. It is compatible with all existing functionality. Therefore, I approve the changes by saying "APPROVE_CHANGES".
