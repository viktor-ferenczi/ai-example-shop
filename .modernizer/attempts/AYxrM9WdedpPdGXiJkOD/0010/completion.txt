 
1. To resolve the issue, we need to add an "alt" attribute to the image tag. The "alt" attribute provides alternative information for an image if a user for some reason cannot view it, such as slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.

2. Here is the modified source code:

```cshtml
<img src="/images/logo.png" width="140px" alt="BuyNow - Online food store">
```

3. The failure conditions to check are:
   - The "alt" attribute is added to the image tag.
   - The "alt" attribute provides alternative information for the image.
   - The "alt" attribute is correctly formatted and placed in the image tag.

4. After reviewing the changes, we can approve the code changes by saying "APPROVE_CHANGES".
