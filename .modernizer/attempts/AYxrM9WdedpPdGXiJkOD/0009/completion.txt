1. Plan:
   - The issue is related to the alt attribute of the img tag. The alt attribute provides alternative information for an image if a user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).
   - I will add an alt attribute to the img tag with a suitable description of the image.

2. Code:
```cshtml
<img src="/images/logo.png" width="140px" alt="BuyNow - Online food store logo">
```

3. Check:
   - The alt attribute is added to the img tag.
   - The alt attribute provides a suitable description of the image.
