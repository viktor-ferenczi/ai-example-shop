 

1. Plan: 
   To resolve the issue, we need to add an "alt" attribute to the image tag. The "alt" attribute provides alternative information for an image if a user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader). In this case, since the image is a logo, a suitable "alt" attribute could be "BuyNow Logo".

2. Code:
```cshtml
<img src="/images/logo.png" width="140px" alt="BuyNow Logo">
```

3. Check:
   - The changes I made fully resolve the issue by adding an "alt" attribute to the image tag.
   - I have not missed any related changes humans would expect to be part of the issue resolution.
   - I have not made any changes, additions or removals to code, data or comments not related to the issue.
   - No part of the source code has been replaced by a placeholder.
