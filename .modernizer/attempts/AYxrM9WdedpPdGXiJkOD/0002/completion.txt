I understand the issue and the context provided. The issue is about the alt attribute for the image tag. The alt attribute provides alternative information for an image if a user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).

Here is the modified source code:

```cshtml
<!-- TOP-MARKER -->
@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity
@using Shop.Data.Models

@inject SignInManager<ApplicationUser> SignInManager
@inject UserManager<ApplicationUser> UserManager

@{
    ViewBag.BodyClass = "bg1";
}

<!-- Rest of the code -->

<img src="/images/logo.png" width="140px" alt="BuyNow Logo">

<!-- Rest of the code -->
```

In the above code, I have added the alt attribute to the image tag. The alt attribute is set to "BuyNow Logo" which provides a brief description of the image.
