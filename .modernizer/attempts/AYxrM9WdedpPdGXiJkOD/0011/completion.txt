1. Plan:
   To resolve the issue, I will add an "alt" attribute to the image tag. The "alt" attribute provides alternative information for an image if a user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader). In this case, the image is a logo for the website, so an appropriate "alt" attribute would be "BuyNow Logo".

2. Code:
```cshtml
<img src="/images/logo.png" width="140px" alt="BuyNow Logo">
```

3. Check:
   - The image now has an "alt" attribute.
   - The "alt" attribute provides an alternative description for the image.
   - The "alt" attribute is not related to any other code, data, or comments.
   - The code is fully compatible with all existing functionality.
