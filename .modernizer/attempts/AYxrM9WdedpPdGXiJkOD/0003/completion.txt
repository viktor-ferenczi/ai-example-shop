1. I plan to add an "alt" attribute to the image tag. This attribute provides alternative information for an image if a user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).

2. Here is the modified source code:
```cshtml
<!-- TOP-MARKER -->
@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity
@using Shop.Data.Models

@inject SignInManager<ApplicationUser> SignInManager
@inject UserManager<ApplicationUser> UserManager

@{
    ViewBag.BodyClass = "bg1";
}

<!-- Rest of the source code... -->

<img src="/images/logo.png" width="140px" alt="BuyNow - Online food store">

<!-- Rest of the source code... -->
```

3. I will check the following failure conditions:
   - The "alt" attribute is added to the image tag.
   - The "alt" attribute's value is descriptive and accurately represents the image.
   - The image is still displayed correctly when the "alt" attribute is added.
   - The image is still displayed correctly when the "alt" attribute is removed.
