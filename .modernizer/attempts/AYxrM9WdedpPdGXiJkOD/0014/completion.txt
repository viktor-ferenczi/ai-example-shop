 

1. Plan:
   To resolve the issue, we need to add an "alt" attribute to the image tag. The "alt" attribute provides alternative information for an image if a user for some reason cannot view it. We can set the "alt" attribute to an empty string, as it's not necessary for this image.

2. Code:
```cshtml
<img src="/images/logo.png" width="140px" alt="">
```

3. Failure conditions:
   - The "alt" attribute is not added to the image tag.
   - The "alt" attribute is added but the value is not an empty string.
   - The image tag is removed or replaced with a placeholder.
