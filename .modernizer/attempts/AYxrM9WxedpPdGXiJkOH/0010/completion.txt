The issue you've reported is about adding a description to the table. This can be achieved by adding a `caption` or `summary` attribute to the table. The `summary` attribute is more descriptive and is used to provide a textual summary of the table's content. Here's how you can modify the code:

```cshtml
<table class="table table-hover" id="latestFoodsTable" summary="This table displays the search results for foods.">
```
