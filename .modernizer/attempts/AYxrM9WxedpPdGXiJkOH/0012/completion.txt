To resolve the issue, we can add a `<caption>` tag to the table. The `<caption>` tag provides a description for the table, which is particularly useful for visually impaired users. Here is the modified code:

```cshtml
<table class="table table-hover" id="latestFoodsTable">
    <caption>List of search results</caption>
    <tbody>
        @foreach (var food in Model.FoodsList)
        {
            <tr>
                <td>
                   @Html.Partial("FoodSummary", food) 
                </td>
            </tr>
        }
    </tbody>
</table>
```
