The issue reported is related to the lack of a description for the table. This is a minor issue that can be resolved by adding a `<caption>` tag to the table. Here is the corrected code:

```cshtml
<table class="table table-hover" id="latestFoodsTable">
    <caption>Table Description: This is a table showing the search results.</caption>
    <tbody>
        @foreach (var food in Model.FoodsList)
        {
            <tr>
                <td>
                   @Html.Partial("FoodSummary", food) 
                </td>
            </tr>
        }
    </tbody>
</table>
```

In the above code, I added a `<caption>` tag with a description of the table. This description is not visible on the page, but it can be read by screen readers and will be displayed in the HTML source code.
