The issue you're facing is about adding a description to the table. This can be done by adding a `<caption>` tag within the `<table>` tag. Here's how you can resolve it:

```cshtml
<table class="table table-hover" id="latestFoodsTable">
    <caption>Search Results</caption>
    <tbody>
        @foreach (var food in Model.FoodsList)
        {
            <tr>
                <td>
                   @Html.Partial("FoodSummary", food) 
                </td>
            </tr>
        }
    </tbody>
</table>
```

In this code, I've added a `<caption>` tag with the text "Search Results". This will provide a description for the table, which is a more accessible way for screen readers and other assistive technologies to understand the table's purpose.

Please let me know if you need further assistance.
