The issue is related to the lack of a description for the table. This is important for accessibility and SEO. 

Here's how you can resolve this issue:

1. Plan:
   - Add a `summary` attribute to the `table` element. This attribute provides a brief description of the table.
   - For the `summary` attribute, consider using a descriptive sentence that includes the name of the table or the purpose of the table.

2. Stop here if you are missing crucial information or do not know how to solve the issue.

3. Resolve the issue:
```cshtml
<table class="table table-hover" id="latestFoodsTable" summary="This table displays the search results">
```

4. Check the failure conditions:
   - The `summary` attribute is added to the `table` element.
   - The `summary` attribute provides a brief description of the table.
   - The `summary` attribute includes the name of the table or the purpose of the table.
   - The `summary` attribute is not related to any other part of the code.

If all these conditions are met, then approve the code changes by saying "APPROVE_CHANGES".
