 
The issue is that the `OrderByDescending` method is being called after the `Where` method, which is incorrect. The `Where` method should be called before the `OrderByDescending` method to ensure that the filtering is done before the ordering.

Here is the corrected code:

```cs
        public IEnumerable<Food> GetPreferred(int count)
        {
            return GetAll().Where(food => food.IsPreferedFood && food.InStock != 0).OrderByDescending(food => food.Id).Take(count);
        }
```
