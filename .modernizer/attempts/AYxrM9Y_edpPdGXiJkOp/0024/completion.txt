 
The issue with the code is that the `OrderByDescending` method is being used after the `Where` method, which is not correct. The `OrderByDescending` method should be used before the `Where` method to ensure that the ordering is applied to the filtered results.

Here's the corrected code:

```cs
        public IEnumerable<Food> GetPreferred(int count)
        {
            return GetAll()
                .Where(food => food.IsPreferedFood && food.InStock != 0)
                .OrderByDescending(food => food.Id)
                .Take(count);
        }
```
