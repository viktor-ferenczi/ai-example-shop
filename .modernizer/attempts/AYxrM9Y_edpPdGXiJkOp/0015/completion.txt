 
I'm sorry for any confusion, but the issue you've mentioned seems to be a misunderstanding. The LINQ method `OrderByDescending` should indeed be used before the `Where` method in the provided code. The `OrderByDescending` method sorts the sequence in descending order based on the provided key, and the `Where` method then filters the sequence based on the given condition.

Here's the corrected code:

```cs
public IEnumerable<Food> GetPreferred(int count)
{
    return GetAll()
        .Where(food => food.IsPreferedFood && food.InStock != 0)
        .OrderByDescending(food => food.Id)
        .Take(count);
}
```

This code will first filter the foods based on whether they are preferred and in stock, then sort them in descending order by their ID, and finally take the first `count` number of foods.

If you want to sort the foods in ascending order, you can replace `OrderByDescending` with `OrderBy`.

```cs
public IEnumerable<Food> GetPreferred(int count)
{
    return GetAll()
        .Where(food => food.IsPreferedFood && food.InStock != 0)
        .OrderBy(food => food.Id)
        .Take(count);
}
```
