 The issue is that the `OrderByDescending` method is being called before the `Where` method. This is causing an error because the `Where` method cannot be called before the `OrderByDescending` method. 

Here is the corrected code:

```cs
public IEnumerable<Food> GetPreferred(int count)
{
    return GetAll()
        .Where(food => food.IsPreferedFood && food.InStock != 0)
        .OrderByDescending(food => food.Id)
        .Take(count);
}
```

This code first filters the foods based on whether they are preferred and in stock. It then orders these filtered foods by their id in descending order. Finally, it takes the first `count` number of foods from this ordered list.
