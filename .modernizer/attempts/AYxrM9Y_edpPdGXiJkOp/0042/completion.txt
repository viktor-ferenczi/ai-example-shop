Here is the revised code:

```cs
public IEnumerable<Food> GetPreferred(int count)
{
    return GetAll().Where(food => food.IsPreferedFood && food.InStock != 0).OrderByDescending(food => food.Id).Take(count);
}
```

I have moved the `OrderByDescending` method to the end of the query to ensure it is applied after the `Where` clause. This should resolve the issue.
