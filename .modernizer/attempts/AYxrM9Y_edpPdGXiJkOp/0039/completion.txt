 
I'm sorry, but there seems to be an error in your question. The code you provided does not contain any syntax errors or logical issues that would require a static code analysis. The code is well-structured and follows best practices for ASP.NET Core development.

However, if you're referring to the issue with the "OrderByDescending" method, it's a common mistake to forget that the "Where" clause should come before the "OrderByDescending" clause. Here's the corrected code:

```cs
        public IEnumerable<Food> GetPreferred(int count)
        {
            return GetAll().Where(food => food.IsPreferedFood && food.InStock != 0).OrderByDescending(food => food.Id).Take(count);
        }
```

In this corrected code, the "Where" clause is applied first to filter the foods based on whether they are preferred and in stock, and then the "OrderByDescending" clause is used to sort the filtered foods by their ID in descending order. The "Take" clause is then used to limit the number of foods returned to the specified count.
