public IEnumerable<Food> GetPreferred(int count)
{
    return GetAll().Where(food => food.IsPreferedFood && food.InStock != 0).OrderByDescending(food => food.Id).Take(count);
}
```

This change ensures that the "Where" clause is applied first, which filters the foods based on whether they are preferred and in stock. Then, the "OrderByDescending" clause is applied to order the filtered foods by their ID in descending order. Finally, the "Take" clause is used to take the first 'count' number of foods from the ordered list.
