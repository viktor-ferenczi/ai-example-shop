 
The issue you're referring to is a common misunderstanding when using LINQ. The "Where" clause should come before the "OrderByDescending" clause in this case. Here's the corrected code:

```cs
        public IEnumerable<Food> GetPreferred(int count)
        {
            return GetAll().Where(food => food.IsPreferedFood && food.InStock != 0).OrderByDescending(food => food.Id).Take(count);
        }
```
