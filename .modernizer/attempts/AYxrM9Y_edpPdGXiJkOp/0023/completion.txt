 

1. The issue is that the "Where" clause is being used after the "OrderByDescending" clause. This is causing an error. The solution is to move the "Where" clause before the "OrderByDescending" clause.

2. Here is the corrected code:

```cs
        public IEnumerable<Food> GetPreferred(int count)
        {
            return GetAll().Where(food => food.IsPreferedFood && food.InStock != 0).OrderByDescending(food => food.Id).Take(count);
        }
```

3. The corrected code block is:

```cs
        public IEnumerable<Food> GetPreferred(int count)
        {
            return GetAll().Where(food => food.IsPreferedFood && food.InStock != 0).OrderByDescending(food => food.Id).Take(count);
        }
```
