 
The issue "Where" should be used before "OrderByDescending" is a misunderstanding of LINQ query operators. In LINQ, the order of operators is important. The "Where" operator should be used before "OrderByDescending" to filter the data before sorting it.

Here is the corrected code:

```cs
        public IEnumerable<Food> GetPreferred(int count)
        {
            return GetAll()
                .Where(food => food.IsPreferedFood && food.InStock != 0)
                .OrderByDescending(food => food.Id)
                .Take(count);
        }
```
