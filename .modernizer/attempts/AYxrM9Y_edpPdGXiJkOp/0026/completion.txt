 
The issue is that the "Where" clause is being used after the "OrderByDescending" clause. This is incorrect because the "Where" clause needs to be used before the "OrderByDescending" clause to filter the results before they are ordered.

Here is the corrected code:

```cs
public IEnumerable<Food> GetPreferred(int count)
{
    return GetAll()
        .Where(food => food.IsPreferedFood && food.InStock != 0)
        .OrderByDescending(food => food.Id)
        .Take(count);
}
```
