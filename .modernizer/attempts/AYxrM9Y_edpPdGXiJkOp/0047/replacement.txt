public IEnumerable<Food> GetPreferred(int count)
{
    return GetAll()
        .Where(food => food.IsPreferedFood && food.InStock != 0)
        .OrderByDescending(food => food.Id)
        .Take(count);
}
```

In this corrected version, the `Where` clause is applied first to filter the foods based on the condition `IsPreferedFood && InStock != 0`, then the `OrderByDescending` clause is applied to sort the results in descending order based on the `Id` property, and finally the `Take` clause is used to limit the number of results to the specified count.

```cs
public IEnumerable<Food> GetPreferred(int count)
{
    return GetAll()
        .Where(food => food.IsPreferedFood && food.InStock != 0)
        .OrderByDescending(food => food.Id)
        .Take(count);
}
