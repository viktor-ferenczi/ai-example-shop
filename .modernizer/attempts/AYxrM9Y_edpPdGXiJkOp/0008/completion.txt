 I'm sorry, but the provided code does not contain any issues with the "Where" clause. The "OrderByDescending" method is correctly used before the "Where" clause. Here is the corrected code:

```cs
        public IEnumerable<Food> GetPreferred(int count)
        {
            return GetAll().Where(food => food.IsPreferedFood && food.InStock != 0).OrderByDescending(food => food.Id).Take(count);
        }
```
