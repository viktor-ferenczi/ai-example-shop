public IEnumerable<Food> GetPreferred(int count)
{
    return GetAll().Where(food => food.IsPreferedFood && food.InStock != 0).OrderByDescending(food => food.Id).Take(count);
}
```

This code first filters the foods based on the condition "IsPreferedFood" and "InStock != 0", then orders them by "Id" in descending order, and finally takes the first "count" number of foods.
