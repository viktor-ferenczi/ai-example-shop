 
The issue reported is about the order of LINQ methods in the GetPreferred method. The "Where" method should be used before the "OrderByDescending" method. Here is the corrected code:

```cs
public IEnumerable<Food> GetPreferred(int count)
{
    return GetAll()
        .Where(food => food.IsPreferedFood && food.InStock != 0)
        .OrderByDescending(food => food.Id)
        .Take(count);
}
```
