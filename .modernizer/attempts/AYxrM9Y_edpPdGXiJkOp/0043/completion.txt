 
The issue you've pointed out is about the order of the methods in the LINQ query. In LINQ, the order of the methods in the query matters. The `Where` method should be called before the `OrderByDescending` method to ensure that the filtering is applied before the sorting.

Here's the corrected code:

```cs
public IEnumerable<Food> GetPreferred(int count)
{
    return GetAll()
        .Where(food => food.IsPreferedFood && food.InStock != 0)
        .OrderByDescending(food => food.Id)
        .Take(count);
}
```
