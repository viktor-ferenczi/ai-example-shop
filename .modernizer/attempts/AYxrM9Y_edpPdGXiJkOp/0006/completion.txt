 
The issue is that the `OrderByDescending` method is being used before the `Where` method. This is incorrect because the `Where` method needs to be called before the `OrderByDescending` method. 

Here is the corrected code:

```cs
        public IEnumerable<Food> GetPreferred(int count)
        {
            return GetAll().Where(food => food.IsPreferedFood && food.InStock != 0).OrderByDescending(food => food.Id).Take(count);
        }
```
