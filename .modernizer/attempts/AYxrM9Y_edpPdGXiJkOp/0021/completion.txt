 
The issue with the code is that the `Where` clause is being used after the `OrderByDescending` clause. The `Where` clause should be used before the `OrderByDescending` clause to filter the results before ordering them.

Here is the corrected code:
```cs
        public IEnumerable<Food> GetPreferred(int count)
        {
            return GetAll().Where(food => food.IsPreferedFood && food.InStock != 0).OrderByDescending(food => food.Id).Take(count);
        }
```
