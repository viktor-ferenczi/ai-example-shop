 
Sure, I understand the issue and the context. The issue is with the LINQ query in the `GetPreferred` method. The `Where` clause should be applied before the `OrderByDescending` clause. Here's the corrected code:

```cs
public IEnumerable<Food> GetPreferred(int count)
{
    return GetAll()
        .Where(food => food.IsPreferedFood && food.InStock != 0)
        .OrderByDescending(food => food.Id)
        .Take(count);
}
```
