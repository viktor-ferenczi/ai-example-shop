 
The issue you're referring to is a common mistake in LINQ queries. The `OrderByDescending` method should be used before the `Where` method. 

Here is the corrected code:

```cs
public IEnumerable<Food> GetPreferred(int count)
{
    return GetAll()
        .Where(food => food.IsPreferedFood && food.InStock != 0)
        .OrderByDescending(food => food.Id)
        .Take(count);
}
```

In this corrected code, the `OrderByDescending` method is used before the `Where` method. This ensures that the foods are filtered before they are ordered by their IDs.

```cs
public IEnumerable<Food> GetPreferred(int count)
{
    return GetAll()
        .Where(food => food.IsPreferedFood && food.InStock != 0)
        .OrderByDescending(food => food.Id)
        .Take(count);
}
```
