 
The issue with the code is that the `Where` clause is being applied before the `OrderByDescending` clause. This is causing the `Where` clause to filter the results before they are ordered.

Here's how you can resolve this issue:

```cs
public IEnumerable<Food> GetPreferred(int count)
{
    return GetAll()
        .Where(food => food.IsPreferedFood && food.InStock != 0)
        .OrderByDescending(food => food.Id)
        .Take(count);
}
```

In this corrected code, the `Where` clause is applied after the `OrderByDescending` clause. This ensures that the filtering is done after the results are ordered, which is the correct order of operations for these LINQ methods.
