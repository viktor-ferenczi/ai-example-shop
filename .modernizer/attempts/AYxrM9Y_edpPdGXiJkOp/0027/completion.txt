Based on the provided information, the issue is with the order of the LINQ methods in the `GetPreferred` method. The `Where` method should be called before the `OrderByDescending` method. Here is the corrected code:

```cs
public IEnumerable<Food> GetPreferred(int count)
{
    return GetAll()
        .Where(food => food.IsPreferedFood && food.InStock != 0)
        .OrderByDescending(food => food.Id)
        .Take(count);
}
```

I have corrected the order of the LINQ methods. This should resolve the issue.
