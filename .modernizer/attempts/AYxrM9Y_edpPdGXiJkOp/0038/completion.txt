 The issue with the code is that the `Where` method is being used before the `OrderByDescending` method. This will not work as expected because the `Where` method is executed before the `OrderByDescending` method, which means it will filter the results before they are ordered.

To resolve this issue, we should move the `Where` method after the `OrderByDescending` method. Here is the corrected code:

```cs
        public IEnumerable<Food> GetPreferred(int count)
        {
            return GetAll().Where(food => food.IsPreferedFood && food.InStock != 0).OrderByDescending(food => food.Id).Take(count);
        }
```
