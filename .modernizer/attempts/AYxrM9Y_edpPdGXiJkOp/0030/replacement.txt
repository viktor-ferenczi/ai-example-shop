public IEnumerable<Food> GetPreferred(int count)
{
    return GetAll().Where(food => food.IsPreferedFood && food.InStock != 0).OrderByDescending(food => food.Id).Take(count);
}
```

In this corrected code, the `Where` clause is applied before the `OrderByDescending` clause. This ensures that the filtering is done before the ordering, which is the intended behavior.
