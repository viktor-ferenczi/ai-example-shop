 
The issue with the code is that the `Where` clause is applied before the `OrderByDescending` clause. This means that the `Where` clause will filter the results after they have been ordered. This is not the intended behavior, as we want to filter the data before ordering it.

Here is the corrected code:

```cs
public IEnumerable<Food> GetPreferred(int count)
{
    return GetAll().Where(food => food.IsPreferedFood && food.InStock != 0).OrderByDescending(food => food.Id).Take(count);
}
```

In this corrected code, the `Where` clause is applied before the `OrderByDescending` clause. This ensures that the filtering is done before the ordering, which is the intended behavior.
