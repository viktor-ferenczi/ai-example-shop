 

1. The issue is that '_userManager' is not declared as 'readonly'. This means that '_userManager' can be modified from outside the class. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior and is generally not recommended.

2. Here is the modified code:

```cs
        private readonly UserManager<ApplicationUser> _userManager;
```

I have made '_userManager' 'readonly' to ensure that it cannot be modified from outside the class. This is a best practice in object-oriented programming to prevent unintended side effects.

```cs
        private readonly UserManager<ApplicationUser> _userManager;
```
