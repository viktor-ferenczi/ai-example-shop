 
Based on the provided context, the issue is with the '_userManager' variable. It's not marked as 'readonly' which means it can be modified outside of its declaration. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential bugs.

Here is the corrected code:

```cs
        private readonly UserManager<ApplicationUser> _userManager;
```

Please note that this issue is considered as 'clear' and 'intentional' by the code analysis tool, which means it's a known issue and it's intended behavior. However, marking variables as 'readonly' is a good practice in C# to prevent accidental changes to them.
