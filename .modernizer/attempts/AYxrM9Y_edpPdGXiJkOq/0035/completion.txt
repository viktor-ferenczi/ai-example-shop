 
The issue is with the usage of `Any` method in the `GetFilteredFoods` method. The `Any` method is used to check if there is any element in the collection that satisfies the condition. However, in this case, the `Any` method is used inside a `Where` method, which is not necessary. 

The `Any` method can be replaced with the `Contains` method, which checks if a collection contains a specific element. In this case, the `Contains` method can be used to check if the `item.Name` contains any of the queries.

Here is the corrected code:

```cs
        public IEnumerable<Food> GetFilteredFoods(string q)
        {
            const int defaultCount = 10;
            var queries = string.IsNullOrEmpty(q) ? null : Regex.Replace(q, @"\s+", " ").Trim().ToLower().Split(" ");
            if (queries == null)
            {
                return GetPreferred(defaultCount);
            }

            return GetAll().Where(item => queries.Any(query => item.Name.ToLower().Contains(query)));
        }
```
