 
The issue you're referring to is about using the `Any` method instead of the `Exists` method. The `Any` method checks if there is at least one element in the collection that satisfies the condition, while the `Exists` method checks if there is at least one element in the collection that satisfies the condition and stops checking as soon as it finds one.

Here is the revised code:

```cs
        public IEnumerable<Food> GetFilteredFoods(string q)
        {
            const int defaultCount = 10;
            var queries = string.IsNullOrEmpty(q) ? null : Regex.Replace(q, @"\s+", " ").Trim().ToLower().Split(" ");
            if (queries == null)
            {
                return GetPreferred(defaultCount);
            }

            return GetAll().Where(item => queries.Exists(query => (item.Name.ToLower().Contains(query))));
        }
```

In this revised code, I've replaced `Any` with `Exists`. The `Exists` method will stop checking as soon as it finds a match, which can potentially improve performance for large collections.
