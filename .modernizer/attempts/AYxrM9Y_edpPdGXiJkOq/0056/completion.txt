 
Based on the provided context, the issue is with the usage of the `Any` method in the `GetFilteredFoods` method. The `Any` method checks if there is at least one element in the collection that satisfies a condition. In this case, it checks if any query matches the food name. 

To resolve this issue, we can replace the `Any` method with the `Contains` method, which checks if a collection contains a specific element. This will ensure that the food name contains at least one of the queries.

Here is the modified code:

```cs
public IEnumerable<Food> GetFilteredFoods(string q)
{
    const int defaultCount = 10;
    var queries = string.IsNullOrEmpty(q) ? null : Regex.Replace(q, @"\s+", " ").Trim().ToLower().Split(" ");
    if (queries == null)
    {
        return GetPreferred(defaultCount);
    }

    return GetAll().Where(item => queries.Any(query => item.Name.ToLower().Contains(query)));
}
```
