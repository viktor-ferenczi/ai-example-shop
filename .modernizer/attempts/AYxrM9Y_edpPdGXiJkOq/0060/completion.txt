 

1. The plan to resolve the issue is as follows:
   - Identify the line of code where the issue is reported.
   - Replace the `Any` method with `Contains` method from the `List` class.
   - Test the code to ensure the issue is resolved.

2. The issue is reported in the following line of code:
```cs
            return GetAll().Where(item => queries.Any(query => (item.Name.ToLower().Contains(query))));
```

3. The modified code is:
```cs
            return GetAll().Where(item => queries.Contains(item.Name.ToLower()));
```

4. The failure conditions to check are:
   - The issue is resolved and the code runs without any errors.
   - The functionality of the code is not affected by this change.
   - No unrelated changes are made to the code, data or comments.
   - No placeholders are used in the code.
