 
The issue highlighted by the static code analysis is that the usage of `Any` method in the LINQ query is not optimal. The `Any` method is used to check if there is at least one element in the sequence that satisfies the condition. However, in this case, it is not necessary to check if there is at least one element that matches the condition, as we are interested in all elements that match the condition.

Here is the optimized code:

```cs
public IEnumerable<Food> GetFilteredFoods(string q)
{
    const int defaultCount = 10;
    var queries = string.IsNullOrEmpty(q) ? null : Regex.Replace(q, @"\s+", " ").Trim().ToLower().Split(" ");
    if (queries == null)
    {
        return GetPreferred(defaultCount);
    }

    return GetAll().Where(item => queries.All(query => (item.Name.ToLower().Contains(query))));
}
```

In the optimized code, `Any` is replaced by `All`. The `All` method checks if all elements in the sequence satisfy the condition. This is more efficient as it stops iterating as soon as it finds an element that does not satisfy the condition. This is especially useful when dealing with large collections of data.

```cs
public IEnumerable<Food> GetFilteredFoods(string q)
{
    const int defaultCount = 10;
    var queries = string.IsNullOrEmpty(q) ? null : Regex.Replace(q, @"\s+", " ").Trim().ToLower().Split(" ");
    if (queries == null)
    {
        return GetPreferred(defaultCount);
    }

    return GetAll().Where(item => queries.All(query => (item.Name.ToLower().Contains(query))));
}
```
