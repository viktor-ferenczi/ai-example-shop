 
The issue you're referring to is about using the `Any` method instead of the `Exists` method in LINQ. The `Any` method checks whether any element in a sequence satisfies a condition, while the `Exists` method checks whether a condition is true for at least one element in a sequence.

In your code, you are using `Any` to check if any query exists in the item name. This is not the most efficient way to do this, because `Any` will stop as soon as it finds a match, while `Exists` will check all elements.

Here's how you can resolve this issue:

```cs
public IEnumerable<Food> GetFilteredFoods(string q)
{
    const int defaultCount = 10;
    var queries = string.IsNullOrEmpty(q) ? null : Regex.Replace(q, @"\s+", " ").Trim().ToLower().Split(" ");
    if (queries == null)
    {
        return GetPreferred(defaultCount);
    }

    return GetAll().Where(item => queries.Exists(query => item.Name.ToLower().Contains(query)));
}
```

In this code, I've replaced `Any` with `Exists`. This should improve the performance of the method.
