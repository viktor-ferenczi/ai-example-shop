 
The issue you're facing is related to the use of the `Any` method in LINQ. The `Any` method checks whether there is at least one element in a sequence that satisfies a condition. However, the `Exists` method is more efficient when it comes to checking whether a condition is true for any element in a collection.

To resolve this issue, you can replace the `Any` method with the `Exists` method. The `Exists` method will stop iterating as soon as it finds an element that satisfies the condition, making it more efficient than the `Any` method.

Here's the modified code:

```cs
public IEnumerable<Food> GetFilteredFoods(string q)
{
    const int defaultCount = 10;
    var queries = string.IsNullOrEmpty(q) ? null : Regex.Replace(q, @"\s+", " ").Trim().ToLower().Split(" ");
    if (queries == null)
    {
        return GetPreferred(defaultCount);
    }

    return GetAll().Where(item => queries.Exists(query => (item.Name.ToLower().Contains(query))));
}
```

In the above code, the `Any` method is replaced with the `Exists` method.
