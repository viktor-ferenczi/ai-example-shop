 

1. The plan to resolve the issue is to replace the `Any` method with the `Contains` method from the `List` class. The `Any` method is used to check if any element in the collection satisfies the condition, while the `Contains` method is used to check if a specific element is in the collection. In this case, we want to check if any query is in the food name.

2. The original code:
```cs
            return GetAll().Where(item => queries.Any(query => (item.Name.ToLower().Contains(query))));
```

3. The modified code:
```cs
            return GetAll().Where(item => queries.Contains(item.Name.ToLower()));
```

4. Checking the failure conditions:
   - The changes have fully resolved the issue because the `Any` method was replaced with the `Contains` method.
   - No related changes were missed.
   - No changes, additions or removals were made to code, data or comments not related to the issue.
   - No placeholders were used.
   - Therefore, the code changes are approved.
