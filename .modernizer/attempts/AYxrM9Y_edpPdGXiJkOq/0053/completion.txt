 

1. The plan for resolving the issue is as follows:
   - The issue is raised because the Any() method is used in the LINQ query, which can lead to unnecessary iterations.
   - To resolve this, we can use the Contains() method instead of Any() in the LINQ query. This will ensure that we are only iterating over the items in the collection once.

2. The code block with the resolved issue is as follows:
```cs
        public IEnumerable<Food> GetFilteredFoods(string q)
        {
            const int defaultCount = 10;
            var queries = string.IsNullOrEmpty(q) ? null : Regex.Replace(q, @"\s+", " ").Trim().ToLower().Split(" ");
            if (queries == null)
            {
                return GetPreferred(defaultCount);
            }

            return GetAll().Where(item => queries.Contains(item.Name.ToLower()));
        }
```

3. The failure conditions are checked as follows:
   - The Any() method is replaced with the Contains() method in the LINQ query.
   - No unrelated changes are made to the code, data or comments.
   - The code is compatible with all existing functionality.
