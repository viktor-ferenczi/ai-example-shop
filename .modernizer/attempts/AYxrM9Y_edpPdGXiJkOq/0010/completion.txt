 
The issue you're facing is related to the usage of the `Any` method in LINQ queries. The `Any` method checks if there is at least one element in a sequence that satisfies a condition, while the `Exists` method is used to check if a condition is true for any element in a collection. 

In your case, you're using `Any` in a LINQ query where `Exists` would be more appropriate. The `Exists` method is a part of the `System.Linq` namespace and can be used to check if a condition is true for any element in a collection. 

Here's how you can modify your code:

```cs
public IEnumerable<Food> GetFilteredFoods(string q)
{
    const int defaultCount = 10;
    var queries = string.IsNullOrEmpty(q) ? null : Regex.Replace(q, @"\s+", " ").Trim().ToLower().Split(" ");
    if (queries == null)
    {
        return GetPreferred(defaultCount);
    }

    return GetAll().Where(item => queries.Exists(query => (item.Name.ToLower().Contains(query))));
}
```

In this modified code, I replaced the `Any` method with the `Exists` method in the LINQ query. This change will ensure that the query checks if any of the queries exist in the food item's name.

Please note that this is just one of the possible solutions. Depending on your specific requirements and the context of your code, there might be other ways to resolve this issue.
