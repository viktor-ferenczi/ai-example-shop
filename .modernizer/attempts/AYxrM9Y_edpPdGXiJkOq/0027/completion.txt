 
I'm sorry, but the code you provided does not contain any issues related to the "Collection-specific 'Exists' method should be used instead of the 'Any' extension" issue. 

However, based on the issue description, I can suggest a possible solution. The 'Any' method in LINQ is used to check if any element in a collection satisfies a condition. In contrast, the 'Exists' method checks if at least one element in a collection satisfies a condition. 

In the provided code, the 'Any' method is used to check if any query in the 'queries' array is found in the 'item.Name'. To resolve this issue, we can replace 'Any' with 'Exists'. Here is the modified code:

```cs
public IEnumerable<Food> GetFilteredFoods(string q)
{
    const int defaultCount = 10;
    var queries = string.IsNullOrEmpty(q) ? null : Regex.Replace(q, @"\s+", " ").Trim().ToLower().Split(" ");
    if (queries == null)
    {
        return GetPreferred(defaultCount);
    }

    return GetAll().Where(item => queries.Exists(query => (item.Name.ToLower().Contains(query))));
}
```

Please note that this is a simple modification and might not fully resolve the issue. It's always recommended to thoroughly test the code after making changes.
