 

1. The plan to resolve the issue:
   - The issue is about the usage of the `Any` method in the `Where` clause. The `Any` method checks if any element in the collection satisfies the condition, which is not efficient in this case.
   - Instead, we can use the `Contains` method, which checks if the collection contains a specific element. This is more efficient.
   - We will replace the `Any` method with the `Contains` method in the `Where` clause.

2. The modified source code:
```cs
        public IEnumerable<Food> GetFilteredFoods(string q)
        {
            const int defaultCount = 10;
            var queries = string.IsNullOrEmpty(q) ? null : Regex.Replace(q, @"\s+", " ").Trim().ToLower().Split(" ");
            if (queries == null)
            {
                return GetPreferred(defaultCount);
            }

            return GetAll().Where(item => queries.Contains(item.Name.ToLower()));
        }
```

3. The failure conditions:
   - The issue is resolved if the `Any` method is replaced with the `Contains` method in the `Where` clause.
   - The issue is not resolved if any other method is used in the `Where` clause.
   - The issue is not resolved if the `Any` method is used in the `Where` clause but does not check if the collection contains a specific element.
   - The issue is not resolved if the `Contains` method is used in the `Where` clause but does not check if any element in the collection satisfies the condition.
   - The issue is not resolved if the `Any` method is used in the `Where` clause but does not check if the collection contains a specific element and does not check if any element in the collection satisfies the condition.
   - The issue is not resolved if the `Contains` method is used in the `Where` clause but does not check if the collection contains a specific element and does not check if any element in the collection satisfies the condition.
