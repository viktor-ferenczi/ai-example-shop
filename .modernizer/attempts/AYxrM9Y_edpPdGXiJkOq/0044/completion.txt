 

1. To resolve the issue, we can replace the `Any` method with the `Contains` method in the LINQ query. The `Any` method checks if any element in the sequence satisfies the condition, while the `Contains` method checks if the sequence contains a specific element. In this case, we are looking for a specific element in the sequence, so we should use the `Contains` method.

2. Here is the modified source code:

```cs
public IEnumerable<Food> GetFilteredFoods(string q)
{
    const int defaultCount = 10;
    var queries = string.IsNullOrEmpty(q) ? null : Regex.Replace(q, @"\s+", " ").Trim().ToLower().Split(" ");
    if (queries == null)
    {
        return GetPreferred(defaultCount);
    }

    return GetAll().Where(item => queries.Any(query => (item.Name.ToLower().Contains(query))));
}
```

3. After the modification, the code should look like this:

```cs
public IEnumerable<Food> GetFilteredFoods(string q)
{
    const int defaultCount = 10;
    var queries = string.IsNullOrEmpty(q) ? null : Regex.Replace(q, @"\s+", " ").Trim().ToLower().Split(" ");
    if (queries == null)
    {
        return GetPreferred(defaultCount);
    }

    return GetAll().Where(item => queries.Contains(item.Name.ToLower()));
}
```

4. Now, let's check the failure conditions:
   - The changes made to the source code have fully resolved the issue as the `Any` method has been replaced with the `Contains` method.
   - No related changes were missed as the only change was to replace the `Any` method with the `Contains` method.
   - No changes, additions or removals were made to code, data or comments not related to the issue.
   - No code was replaced by a placeholder.

Therefore, I approve the code changes by saying "APPROVE_CHANGES".
