 
The issue "Collection-specific "Exists" method should be used instead of the "Any" extension" is related to performance. The "Any" extension method is a LINQ extension method that checks whether any element in a sequence satisfies a condition. It does this by enumerating the sequence until it finds an element that satisfies the condition, or until it has enumerated the entire sequence. This can be inefficient if the sequence is large, as it may need to enumerate the entire sequence before it can determine whether any element satisfies the condition.

In contrast, the "Exists" method is a collection-specific method that checks whether any element in a collection satisfies a condition. It does this by iterating over the collection until it finds an element that satisfies the condition, or until it has iterated over the entire collection. This can be more efficient than the "Any" method, as it can stop iterating as soon as it finds an element that satisfies the condition.

To resolve this issue, we can replace the "Any" extension method with the "Exists" method in the following line of code:

```cs
return GetAll().Where(item => queries.Any(query => (item.Name.ToLower().Contains(query))));
```

Here is the modified code:

```cs
return GetAll().Where(item => queries.Exists(query => (item.Name.ToLower().Contains(query))));
```
