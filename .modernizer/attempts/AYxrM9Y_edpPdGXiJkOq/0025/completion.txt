 

1. The problem is that the `Any` method is used in the `Where` clause, which is not efficient. The `Any` method will stop iterating as soon as it finds a match, while the `Exists` method will continue to iterate through the entire collection. This can lead to unnecessary iterations and performance issues. The solution is to replace the `Any` method with the `Contains` method, which is more efficient.

2. Here is the modified code:

```cs
public IEnumerable<Food> GetFilteredFoods(string q)
{
    const int defaultCount = 10;
    var queries = string.IsNullOrEmpty(q) ? null : Regex.Replace(q, @"\s+", " ").Trim().ToLower().Split(" ");
    if (queries == null)
    {
        return GetPreferred(defaultCount);
    }

    return GetAll().Where(item => queries.Contains(item.Name.ToLower()));
}
```
