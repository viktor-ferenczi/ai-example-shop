 
I'm sorry, but the issue you're referring to is not clear. The static code analysis tool you're using is suggesting to rename the parameter 'userId' to 'id' in the method 'GetUserMostPopularFoods'. However, the method is part of the interface 'IOrder' and the method signature in the interface is 'GetByUserId(string userId)'. The method 'GetByUserId' takes a parameter named 'userId' and not 'id'. 

If you want to rename the parameter in the method 'GetUserMostPopularFoods', it would be a breaking change for the interface 'IOrder'. This would require changing the interface and potentially breaking any other implementations of this interface.

If you want to change the parameter name in the interface 'IOrder', you would need to change the interface and potentially break any other implementations of this interface.

If you want to change the parameter name in the method 'GetByUserId', you would need to change the method and potentially break any other implementations of this method.

If you want to change the parameter name in both the interface and the method, you would need to change both and potentially break any other implementations of these.

I'm afraid that without more context, it's not possible to provide a solution. Please provide more information about the issue you're facing.
