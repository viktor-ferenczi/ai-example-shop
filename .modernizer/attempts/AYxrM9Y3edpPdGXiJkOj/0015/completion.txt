 
I'm sorry, but the issue you've mentioned seems to be a naming inconsistency between the method parameter and the interface declaration. However, without the context of the interface declaration, it's hard to provide a precise solution. 

However, if we assume that the interface declaration is correct and the parameter name in the method should be 'id', here's how you can resolve the issue:

```cs
        public IEnumerable<Food> GetUserMostPopularFoods(string id)
```
