 
I'm sorry, but the provided code does not seem to have any issues related to the parameter renaming. The method `GetUserMostPopularFoods(string userId)` is correctly named as per the interface declaration.

However, if you want to rename the parameter, the corrected code would look like this:

```cs
        public IEnumerable<Food> GetUserMostPopularFoods(string id)
        {
            Dictionary<Food, int> foods = new Dictionary<Food, int>();

            var a = GetByUserId(id);
            foreach (var order in a)
            {
                foreach (var line in order.OrderLines)
                {
                    if (foods.ContainsKey(line.Food))
                    {
                        foods[line.Food] += line.Amount;
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        foods[line.Food] = line.Amount;
                    }
                }
            }

            return foods.OrderByDescending(keyValues => keyValues.Value).Select((keyValues) => keyValues.Key).Take(10);
        }
```

Please note that this change is only necessary if the parameter name is used elsewhere in the code. If it's not used elsewhere, the parameter name remains the same.
