 
Sure, I understand the issue and the context. Here's how I would resolve it:

1. Plan:
   - I would add `<th>` headers to the table to provide clarity to the user about what each column represents.

2. Code:
```cshtml
<table class="table table-hover" id="categoryIndexTable">
    <caption>Table of food categories</caption>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Category</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        @foreach (var category in Model.CategoryList)
        {
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <div class="categoryLogo" style="background-image: url(@category.ImageUrl); background-size:100%;"></div>
                    <a class="btn btn-info" asp-controller="Category" asp-action="Topic" asp-route-id="@category.Id">
                        @category.Name
                    </a>
                </td>
                <td>
                    @category.Description
                </td>
            </tr>
        }
    </tbody>
</table>
```
