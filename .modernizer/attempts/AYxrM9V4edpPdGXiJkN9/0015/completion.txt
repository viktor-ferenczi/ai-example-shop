Sure, here's how you can resolve the issue:

1. First, let's plan our approach. We need to add `<th>` headers to the table. The `<th>` tag defines a header cell in an HTML table.

2. Now, let's implement the plan. We will add `<th>` headers to the table:

```cshtml
<table class="table table-hover" id="categoryIndexTable">
    <caption>Table of food categories</caption>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Category</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        @foreach (var category in Model.CategoryList)
        {
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <div class="categoryLogo" style="background-image: url(@category.ImageUrl); background-size:100%;"></div>
                    <a class="btn btn-info" asp-controller="Category" asp-action="Topic" asp-route-id="@category.Id">
                        @category.Name
                    </a>
                </td>
                <td>
                    @category.Description
                </td>
            </tr>
        }
    </tbody>
</table>
```

3. Now, we have implemented the plan and added `<th>` headers to the table.

4. Let's check our changes:
