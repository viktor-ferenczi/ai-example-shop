 

1. The issue is related to redundant parenthesis in the 'AddToCart' method. The parenthesis are not necessary and can be removed.

2. The issue is related to the 'AddToCart' method. The method is returning a boolean value to indicate whether the addition was successful or not. However, it does not provide any additional information if the amount is invalid. This could lead to confusion for the view. It would be better to throw an exception instead of returning a boolean value.

3. The issue is related to the 'AddToCart' method. The method is too complex and has too much branching. It would be better to refactor the code to make it more readable and maintainable.

4. The issue is related to the 'AddToCart' method. The method is doing too much application- or domain-level logic. It would be better to move this logic to a separate service or helper class.

5. The issue is related to the 'AddToCart' method. The method is using Entity Framework's SingleOrDefault method to retrieve a shopping cart item. This method can return null if no matching item is found. It would be better to use FirstOrDefault instead, which will throw an exception if no matching item is found.
