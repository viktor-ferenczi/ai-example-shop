 

1. The issue at the marked line is a redundant parenthesis. The parenthesis are not necessary and can be removed.

2. Here is the modified source code:

```cs
        //TODO redundant parenthesis
        if (food.InStock - shoppingCartItem.Amount - amount >= 0)
        {
            shoppingCartItem.Amount += amount;
        }
        else
        {
            shoppingCartItem.Amount += food.InStock - shoppingCartItem.Amount;
            isValidAmount = false;
        }
```
