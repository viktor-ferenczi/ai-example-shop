 

1. Step-by-step plan for resolving the issue:

The issue is related to the redundant parenthesis in the following code block:
```cs
if (food.InStock - shoppingCartItem.Amount - amount >= 0)
{
    shoppingCartItem.Amount += amount;
}
else
{
    shoppingCartItem.Amount += (food.InStock - shoppingCartItem.Amount);
    isValidAmount = false;
}
```
The redundant parenthesis can be removed to make the code more readable and easier to understand.

2. Code modification:

```cs
if (food.InStock - shoppingCartItem.Amount - amount >= 0)
{
    shoppingCartItem.Amount += amount;
}
else
{
    shoppingCartItem.Amount += food.InStock - shoppingCartItem.Amount;
    isValidAmount = false;
}
```

3. Failure conditions check:

- The changes made to the code are fully resolved the issue.
- The changes made are consistent with the original code and do not introduce any new bugs or issues.
- The code is still readable and easy to understand.
- The code does not contain any unnecessary changes or additions.
- The code does not replace any placeholder.
