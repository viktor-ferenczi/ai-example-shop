 The issue reported in the static code analysis is related to the class `Program` not having a constructor or a static keyword. This is a common issue in C#, especially when creating a class that will be used as a static class.

Here is the corrected code:

```cs
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

namespace Shop.Web
{
    public static class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            BuildWebHost(args).Run();
        }

        public static IWebHost BuildWebHost(string[] args) =>
            WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
                .UseStartup<Startup>()
                .Build();
    }
}
```

In this corrected code, I have added the `static` keyword to the class declaration. This makes the class `Program` a static class, which means it cannot be instantiated and only contains static members. This is necessary for the `Main` method to be able to be called without creating an instance of the `Program` class.
