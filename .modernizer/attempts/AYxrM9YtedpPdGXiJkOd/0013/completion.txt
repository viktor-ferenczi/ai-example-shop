 The issue reported is about the lack of a constructor in the `Program` class. In .NET, a class must have at least one constructor. If a class does not have any constructor, a default constructor is automatically provided by the compiler. However, in this case, the `Program` class does not have a constructor, which is causing the static code analysis to report an issue.

To resolve this issue, we can add a constructor to the `Program` class. Here's how we can do it:

```cs
// TOP-MARKER
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

namespace Shop.Web
{
    public class Program
    {
        public Program()
        {
            // Constructor logic can be added here if needed.
        }

        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            BuildWebHost(args).Run();
        }

        public static IWebHost BuildWebHost(string[] args) =>
            WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
                .UseStartup<Startup>()
                .Build();
    }
}
```
