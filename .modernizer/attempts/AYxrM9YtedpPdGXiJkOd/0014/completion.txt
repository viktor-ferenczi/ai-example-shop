 The issue reported is about the lack of a constructor in the `Program` class. Constructors are necessary in classes to initialize objects of that class. In this case, the `Program` class does not have any constructor, so it's considered a violation of the C# language rules.

Here is the corrected code:

```cs
// TOP-MARKER
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

namespace Shop.Web
{
    public class Program
    {
        protected Program()
        {
            // Constructor is protected to prevent instantiation of this class
        }

        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            BuildWebHost(args).Run();
        }

        public static IWebHost BuildWebHost(string[] args) =>
            WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
                .UseStartup<Startup>()
                .Build();
    }
}
```

In this corrected code, I've added a protected constructor to the `Program` class. This constructor does nothing, but it prevents the instantiation of the class, which is what the static code analysis was complaining about.
