 The issue reported is a false positive and can be ignored. The code provided does not have any issues that require immediate attention. The static code analysis tool is likely to report false positives from time to time, especially in larger codebases.

The code provided is a standard ASP.NET Core application startup class. It has a public static method `Main` which is the entry point of the application and a public static method `BuildWebHost` which is used to configure and build the web host. These methods are not intended to be instantiated or inherited, hence the warning.

Here is the corrected code:

```cs
// TOP-MARKER
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

namespace Shop.Web
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            BuildWebHost(args).Run();
        }

        public static IWebHost BuildWebHost(string[] args) =>
            WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
                .UseStartup<Startup>()
                .Build();
    }
}
```
