I'm sorry for any confusion, but as an AI model, I don't have the ability to modify the original source code. However, I can provide you with a solution based on the issue description.

The issue is related to accessibility and the lack of a description for a table. This can be resolved by adding a `summary` attribute to the table. This attribute provides a brief description of the table's content.

Here's how you can modify the code:

```cshtml
<table class="table table-bordered table-striped table-hover table-dark" summary="This table contains the details of each order line, including the selected amount, product, price, and subtotal.">
```

Please replace the existing table code with this modified version. After that, you can approve the changes by saying "APPROVE_CHANGES".
