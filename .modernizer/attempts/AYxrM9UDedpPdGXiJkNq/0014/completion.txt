 

1. Here is the step by step plan for resolving the issue:

   - First, rename the parameter 'modelBuilder' to 'builder' to match the base class declaration.
   - Then, replace all occurrences of 'modelBuilder' with 'builder' in the rest of the code.
   - Finally, test the code to ensure that the issue has been resolved.

2. Based on the provided context, all the necessary information is available to resolve the issue.

3. Here is the modified source code:

```cs
// TOP-MARKER
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.EntityFrameworkCore;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using Shop.Data.Models;

namespace Shop.Data
{
    public class ApplicationDbContext : IdentityDbContext<ApplicationUser>
    {
        public ApplicationDbContext(DbContextOptions<ApplicationDbContext> options) : base(options)
        {
        }

        protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder builder)
        {
            base.OnModelCreating(builder);

            builder.Entity<Food>()
                .HasOne(f => f.Category)
                .WithMany(c => c.Foods)
                .IsRequired()
                .OnDelete(DeleteBehavior.Cascade);

            builder.Entity<ShoppingCartItem>()
                .HasOne(sci => sci.Food);

            builder.Entity<ApplicationUser>()
                .HasIndex(user => user.Email)
                .IsUnique(true);
        }

        public DbSet<Food> Foods { get; set; }
        public DbSet<Category> Categories { get; set; }
        public DbSet<ShoppingCartItem> ShoppingCartItems { get; set; }
        public DbSet<Order> Orders { get; set; }
        public DbSet<OrderDetail> OrderDetails { get; set; }

    }
}
```

4. The failure conditions are as follows:

   - The changes made to the code do not fully resolve the issue.
   - There are no related changes humans would expect to be part of the issue resolution.
   - No changes, additions or removals to code, data or comments are made unrelated to the issue.
   - No code is replaced by a placeholder.

Therefore, I approve the code changes by saying "APPROVE_CHANGES".
