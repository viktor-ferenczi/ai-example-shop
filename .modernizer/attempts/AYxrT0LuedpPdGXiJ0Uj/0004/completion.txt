 
I'm sorry, but the code you provided does not contain any issues that need to be resolved. The static code analysis tool reported an issue with the '_userManager' field, but the code provided does not contain any issues related to this field. 

The static code analysis tool is suggesting that the '_userManager' field is not being used anywhere in the code. This could be a false positive, or it could be a legitimate issue if '_userManager' is not being used in the context where it should be used. 

If '_userManager' is not being used, you could consider removing it from the constructor and the class declaration to clean up the code. However, if '_userManager' is being used elsewhere in the code, you should not remove it without understanding why it's there and what its purpose is.

Here's the revised code:

```cs
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Shop.Data;
using Shop.Data.Enums;
using Shop.Data.Models;
using Shop.Web.DataMapper;
using Shop.Web.Models.Order;
using System;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace Shop.Web.Controllers
{
    [Authorize]
    public class OrderController : Controller
    {
        private readonly IOrder _orderService;
        private readonly IFood _foodService;
        private readonly ShoppingCart _shoppingCart;
        private readonly UserManager<ApplicationUser> _userManager; // Making '_userManager' readonly


        public OrderController(IOrder orderService, IFood foodService, ShoppingCart shoppingCart, UserManager<ApplicationUser> userManager)
        {
            _orderService = orderService;
            _shoppingCart = shoppingCart;
            _userManager = userManager;
            _foodService = foodService;
        }

        public IActionResult Checkout()
        {
            var items = _shoppingCart.GetShoppingCartItems();
            _shoppingCart.ShoppingCartItems = items;
            if (!items.Any())
            {
                ModelState.AddModelError("", "Your cart is empty, add some items first");
                return RedirectToAction("Index", "Home");
            }
            return View();
        }

        // Rest of the code...
    }
}
```
