 

1. Plan:
   To resolve this issue, we need to encapsulate the complex evaluation in the if statement into a separate function. This will make the code easier to read and maintain. The function could be named `CanAddToCart`.

2. Ignore:
   I have all the necessary information to resolve the issue.

3. Code:
```cs
public bool AddToCart(Food food, int amount)
{
    if (food.InStock == 0 || amount == 0)
    {
        return false;
    }

    var shoppingCartItem = _context.ShoppingCartItems.SingleOrDefault(
        s => s.Food.Id == food.Id && s.ShoppingCartId == Id);
    var isValidAmount = true;
    if (shoppingCartItem == null)
    {
        if (amount > food.InStock)
        {
            isValidAmount = false;
        }
        shoppingCartItem = new ShoppingCartItem
        {
            ShoppingCartId = Id,
            Food = food,
            Amount = Math.Min(food.InStock, amount)
        };
        _context.ShoppingCartItems.Add(shoppingCartItem);
    }
    else
    {
        if (!CanAddToCart(food, shoppingCartItem, amount))
        {
            isValidAmount = false;
        }
        else
        {
            shoppingCartItem.Amount += amount;
        }
    }

    _context.SaveChanges();
    return isValidAmount;
}

private bool CanAddToCart(Food food, ShoppingCartItem shoppingCartItem, int amount)
{
    return food.InStock - shoppingCartItem.Amount - amount >= 0;
}
```

4. Failure Conditions:
   - The `AddToCart` method now only checks if the food is in stock and if the amount is valid, and then calls the `CanAddToCart` method to check if the amount can be added to the cart.
   - The `CanAddToCart` method checks if the amount can be added to the cart without exceeding the food's stock.
   - The `AddToCart` method now only adds the amount to the cart if it can be added.
   - The `AddToCart` method now saves the changes to the database after the cart has been updated.
   - The `AddToCart` method now returns a boolean indicating whether the amount was valid.
   - No changes were made to the source code unrelated to the issue.
   - The code is compatible with all existing functionality.
   - The code is easy to read and maintain.
