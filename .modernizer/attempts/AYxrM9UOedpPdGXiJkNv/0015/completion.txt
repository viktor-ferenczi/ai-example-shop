1. The plan to resolve this issue is as follows:
   - We need to refactor the `AddToCart` method to make the complex evaluation as a function. This will make the code cleaner and easier to understand.

2. The code modification to resolve the issue is as follows:
```cs
public bool AddToCart(Food food, int amount)
{
    if (food.InStock == 0 || amount == 0)
    {
        return false;
    }

    var shoppingCartItem = _context.ShoppingCartItems.SingleOrDefault(
        s => s.Food.Id == food.Id && s.ShoppingCartId == Id);
    var isValidAmount = true;
    if (shoppingCartItem == null)
    {
        if (amount > food.InStock)
        {
            isValidAmount = false;
        }
        shoppingCartItem = new ShoppingCartItem
        {
            ShoppingCartId = Id,
            Food = food,
            Amount = Math.Min(food.InStock, amount)
        };
        _context.ShoppingCartItems.Add(shoppingCartItem);
    }
    else
    {
        if (!IsValidAmount(food, shoppingCartItem, amount))
        {
            isValidAmount = false;
        }
        else
        {
            shoppingCartItem.Amount += amount;
        }
    }

    _context.SaveChanges();
    return isValidAmount;
}

private bool IsValidAmount(Food food, ShoppingCartItem shoppingCartItem, int amount)
{
    return food.InStock - shoppingCartItem.Amount - amount >= 0;
}
```

3. The modified code is now complete and only includes changes related to the issue. The `IsValidAmount` method has been added to handle the complex evaluation. The `AddToCart` method now calls this method to check if the amount is valid.

4. The failure conditions are as follows:
   - The code has been modified to include the `IsValidAmount` method and call it in the `AddToCart` method.
   - The `IsValidAmount` method checks if the amount is valid by subtracting the current amount from the food's stock.
   - The `AddToCart` method now only adds the amount to the shopping cart item if it is valid.
   - The code has not been modified to include any unrelated changes.
   - The code has not been modified to remove any unrelated code.
   - The code has not been modified to replace any placeholder.
   - The code has not been modified to break any existing functionality.
   - The code has not been modified to introduce any performance or security issues.
   - The code has not been modified to change any comments or string literals unrelated to the issue.
   - The code has not been modified to remove any code (even if it is commented out or disabled) unless asked explicitly.
   - The code has not been modified to update any comments which apply to code you have to change.
   - The code is written in a way that is easily readable by humans.
   - The code has not been modified to remove any commented out code unless asked explicitly.
