 
1. To resolve the issue, I will add a `<caption>` tag to the table. This tag will provide a description of the table to screen readers and other assistive technologies. Here is the updated code:

```cshtml
<table class="table table-hover table-bordered" id="categoryIndexTable">
    <caption>Table showing the list of food items for the category @Model.Category.Name</caption>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Food</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        @foreach (var food in Model.Foods)
        {
            <tr>
                <td>
                   @Html.Partial("FoodSummary",food) 
                </td>
            </tr>
        }
    </tbody>
</table>
```

2. After reviewing the changes, I have found that the changes I made are fully resolving the issue. The `<caption>` tag provides a description of the table, which is crucial for screen readers and other assistive technologies. I have not made any changes to code, data or comments unrelated to the issue. The changes I made are compatible with all existing functionality. Therefore, I approve the code changes by saying "APPROVE_CHANGES".
