 
I'm sorry, but the provided code does not contain any issues that need to be addressed. The code is well-structured and follows best practices for ASP.NET Core development. It includes comments, error handling, and security measures, which are all important aspects of good code. The code also includes a check to ensure that only admins can see and interact with certain elements of the page, which is a good practice for user authentication and authorization. 

However, if you want to add a description to the table, you can do so by adding a `<caption>` tag inside the `<table>` tag. Here's how you can do it:

```cshtml
<table class="table table-hover table-bordered" id="categoryIndexTable">
    <caption>Description of the table</caption>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Food</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        @foreach (var food in Model.Foods)
        {
            <tr>
                <td>
                   @Html.Partial("FoodSummary",food) 
                </td>
            </tr>
        }
    </tbody>
</table>
```

Please replace "Description of the table" with your actual description.
