I'm sorry, but as an AI model, I don't have the ability to modify the source code directly or interact with the file system. However, I can provide a solution based on the given context.

The issue is about adding a description to the table. We can add a `<caption>` tag inside the `<table>` tag to provide a description. Here is the modified code:

```cshtml
<table class="table table-hover table-bordered" id="categoryIndexTable">
    <caption>Table of Foods in @Model.Category.Name Category</caption>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Food</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        @foreach (var food in Model.Foods)
        {
            <tr>
                <td>
                   @Html.Partial("FoodSummary",food) 
                </td>
            </tr>
        }
    </tbody>
</table>
```

In this code, I added a `<caption>` tag with a description of the table's content. The description is "Table of Foods in [Category Name] Category", which provides a clear and concise description of the table's content.
