I'm sorry for any confusion, but as an AI model, I don't have the ability to directly modify the source code. However, I can suggest a solution based on the issue description and the context provided.

The issue is about adding a description to the table. This can be achieved by adding a `<caption>` tag inside the `<table>` tag. The `<caption>` tag is used to provide a description for a table. Here's how you can do it:

```cshtml
<table class="table table-hover table-bordered" id="categoryIndexTable">
    <caption>Table Description: This table displays the list of foods in the category.</caption>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Food</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        @foreach (var food in Model.Foods)
        {
            <tr>
                <td>
                   @Html.Partial("FoodSummary",food) 
                </td>
            </tr>
        }
    </tbody>
</table>
```

In the above code, I've added a `<caption>` tag with a description inside the `<table>` tag. Please replace "Table Description: This table displays the list of foods in the category." with your desired description.

Please note that this is a simple solution and might not be suitable for all scenarios. If the table is complex or has a dynamic description, you might need to consider other solutions.
