 

1. Plan:
   To resolve the issue, we need to add a description to the table. This can be done by adding a `<caption>` tag within the `<table>` tag. The description can be added as a string that explains the purpose of the table.

2. Code:
   ```cshtml
   <table class="table table-hover table-bordered" id="categoryIndexTable">
       <caption>This table displays the list of foods in the category.</caption>
       <thead>
           <tr>
               <th>Food</th>
           </tr>
       </thead>
       <tbody>
           @foreach (var food in Model.Foods)
           {
               <tr>
                   <td>
                       @Html.Partial("FoodSummary",food) 
                   </td>
               </tr>
           }
       </tbody>
   </table>
   ```
   In the above code, I added a `<caption>` tag within the `<table>` tag. The description is "This table displays the list of foods in the category.".

3. Failure Conditions:
   - The code should add a `<caption>` tag within the `<table>` tag.
   - The `<caption>` tag should contain a description of the table.
   - The description should be clear and concise.
   - The description should be related to the purpose of the table.
