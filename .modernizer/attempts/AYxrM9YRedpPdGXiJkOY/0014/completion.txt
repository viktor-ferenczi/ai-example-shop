 The issue reported at the line of code:
```cs
        // public int PageNumber { get; set; }
```
is not an issue, but rather a commented out line of code. The code is not used in the current context and is commented out. If the issue is indeed to remove this commented out code, then the corrected code should be:

```cs
        public int PageNumber { get; set; }
```
