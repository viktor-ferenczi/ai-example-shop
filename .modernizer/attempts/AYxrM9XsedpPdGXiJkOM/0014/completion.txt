 

1. The issue is related to the direct access of data layer from the web layer. This breaks the principle of separation of concerns, which is a key aspect of clean architecture. To resolve this, we need to move the data access code from the web layer to the data layer.

2. Here is the modified source code:

```cs
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Shop.Data.Models;
using Shop.Web.Models.Category;
using Shop.Web.Models.Food;
using System.Linq;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using Shop.Web.DataMapper;

namespace Shop.Web.Controllers
{
    public class CategoryController : Controller
    {
        private readonly ICategory _categoryService;
        private readonly IFood _foodService;
        private readonly Mapper _mapper;

        public CategoryController(ICategory categoryService, IFood foodService)
        {
            _categoryService = categoryService;
            _foodService = foodService;
            _mapper = new Mapper();
        }

        public IActionResult Index()
        {
            var categories = _categoryService.GetAll().
                Select(category => new CategoryListingModel
                {
                    Name = category.Name,
                    Description = category.Description,
                    Id = category.Id,
                    ImageUrl = category.ImageUrl
                });

            var model = new CategoryIndexModel
            {
                CategoryList = categories
            };

            return View(model);
        }

        // other methods remain the same
    }
}
```

APPROVE_CHANGES

The data layer access has been moved from the web layer to the data layer. This follows the principle of separation of concerns and makes the code more maintainable and testable.
