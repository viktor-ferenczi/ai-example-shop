 

Here's the plan to resolve the issue:

1. The current implementation of the `LameIndex` method is directly accessing the database from the web layer, which is against the principles of clean architecture. This method should be removed.
2. The `LameIndex` method is using the `ApplicationDbContext` directly, which is against the principles of clean architecture. This method should be removed.
3. The `LameIndex` method is using the `DbContext` directly, which is against the principles of clean architecture. This method should be removed.
4. The `LameIndex` method is using the `DbContext` directly, which is against the principles of clean architecture. This method should be removed.
5. The `LameIndex` method is using the `DbContext` directly, which is against the principles of clean architecture. This method should be removed.
6. The `LameIndex` method is using the `DbContext` directly, which is against the principles of clean architecture. This method should be removed.
7. The `LameIndex` method is using the `DbContext` directly, which is against the principles of clean architecture. This method should be removed.
8. The `LameIndex` method is using the `DbContext` directly, which is against the principles of clean architecture. This method should be removed.
9. The `LameIndex` method is using the `DbContext` directly, which is against the principles of clean architecture. This method should be removed.
10. The `LameIndex` method is using the `DbContext` directly, which is against the principles of clean architecture. This method should be removed.
