 
I'm sorry for the confusion, but the issue you've mentioned seems to be a naming convention issue. The parameter 'q' in the method `GetFilteredFoods(int id, string q)` is named 'q', which is not consistent with the naming convention used in the other methods in the class. It would be more appropriate to rename it to 'searchQuery' to match the interface declaration. Here's the modified code:

```cs
        public IEnumerable<Food> GetFilteredFoods(int id, string searchQuery)
        {
            if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(searchQuery) || string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(searchQuery))
            {
                return GetFoodsByCategoryId(id);
            }

            return GetFilteredFoods(searchQuery).Where(food => food.Category.Id == id);
        }
```

Please note that this change will not affect the functionality of the code. It's just a naming convention change.
