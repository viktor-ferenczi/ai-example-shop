 
I'm sorry, but the issue you've mentioned is not related to the provided source code. The issue is about renaming the parameter 'q' to 'searchQuery' in the 'GetFilteredFoods' method. However, the provided source code does not contain a method with the name 'GetFilteredFoods' that takes two parameters.

Here is the corrected method:

```cs
        public IEnumerable<Food> GetFilteredFoods(int id, string searchQuery)
        {
            if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(searchQuery) || string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(searchQuery))
            {
                return GetFoodsByCategoryId(id);
            }

            return GetFilteredFoods(searchQuery).Where(food => food.Category.Id == id);
        }
```

Please replace the old method with this corrected one.
