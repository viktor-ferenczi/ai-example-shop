 
I'm sorry for the confusion, but the issue you've mentioned is not related to the provided code. The code you've provided does not contain any parameter named 'q'. It contains a method named 'GetFilteredFoods' which takes two parameters: 'id' and 'q'. 

If you're referring to the parameter 'q' in the 'GetFilteredFoods' method, then the issue is that the parameter name is not descriptive. It's not clear what 'q' stands for without looking at the method's implementation or the surrounding code. It would be better to rename 'q' to something more descriptive, like 'searchQuery'.

Here's how you can rename the parameter:

```cs
        public IEnumerable<Food> GetFilteredFoods(int id, string searchQuery)
```

Please remember to update all the places where this method is called to reflect the new parameter name.
