 The issue you're facing is a warning from the static code analysis tool about the usage of the "summary" attribute in the HTML table element. This attribute is not supported in HTML5 and is considered deprecated.

Here's how you can resolve the issue:

1. Plan: Since the "summary" attribute is not supported in HTML5, we need to remove it from the table element.

2. Implementation:
```cshtml
<!-- TOP-MARKER -->
@model Shop.Web.Models.Home.HomeIndexModel

<div class="container body-content">
    <div class="row frontPageSplash">
        <div class="col-md-6 frontPageLearn">
            <div class="frontPageHeading">Healthy, Cheap, Easy...</div>
            <p class="frontPageSubHeading">This is online shopping site for food</p>
            <div>
                <form asp-controller="Home" asp-action="Search" method="post">
                    <input asp-for="SearchQuery" type="text" class="homeSearch" placeholder="Search..." />
                </form>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="row frontPageContent">
        <h3 id="latestFoods">Prefered products</h3>
        <table class="table table-hover" id="latestFoodsTable">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Food</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                @foreach (var food in Model.FoodsList)
                {
                    <tr>
                        <td>
                           @Html.Partial("FoodSummary", food) 
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                }
            </tbody>
        </table>
    </div>
</div>
```

3. Check:
   - The "summary" attribute has been removed from the table element.
   - The table still functions as intended, with the same content and layout.
   - No other changes were made to the code that were not related to the issue.
   - The table element now conforms to HTML5 standards.
