 
The issue you're facing is about the "summary" attribute in the HTML table tag. This attribute is not standard and is deprecated in HTML5. 

Here's how you can resolve the issue:

1. Plan:
   - Remove the "summary" attribute from the HTML table tag.

2. Code:
```cshtml
        <table class="table table-hover" id="latestFoodsTable">
```

3. Check:
   - Check if the "summary" attribute has been removed from the HTML table tag.
   - Check if the table still functions as expected.
   - Check if there are any other changes that are not related to the issue.

4. Approval:
```cshtml
        <table class="table table-hover" id="latestFoodsTable">
```
