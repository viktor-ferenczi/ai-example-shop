 
The issue is about adding a description to the table. However, the table doesn't have a `<caption>` or `<summary>` tag to provide a description. 

Here's the modified source code:

```cshtml
<div class="row frontPageContent">
    <table class="table table-hover" id="latestFoodsTable" summary="Prefered products">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Food</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            @foreach (var food in Model.FoodsList)
            {
                <tr>
                    <td>
                       @Html.Partial("FoodSummary", food) 
                    </td>
                </tr>
            }
        </tbody>
    </table>
</div>
```
