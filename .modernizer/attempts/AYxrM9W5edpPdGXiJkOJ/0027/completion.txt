To resolve the issue about adding a description to the table, we can add an aria-describedby attribute to the table element. This attribute will point to the ID of the element that contains the description. Here is how we can do it:

```cshtml
<table class="table table-hover" id="latestFoodsTable" aria-describedby="latestFoodsTableDescription">
```

Then, we can add a description element with the ID we specified in the aria-describedby attribute:

```cshtml
<div id="latestFoodsTableDescription" style="display: none;">
    This is a description for the Prefered products table.
</div>
```
