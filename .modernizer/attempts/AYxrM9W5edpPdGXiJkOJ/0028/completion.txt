 
The issue you've identified is about adding a description to the table. The table is identified by the id "latestFoodsTable". To add a description, we can use the `aria-describedby` attribute in HTML. This attribute can be used to provide a description for the table. 

Here's the modified code:

```cshtml
<table class="table table-hover" id="latestFoodsTable" aria-describedby="latestFoodsTableDescription">
```

In the HTML body, we can add a description for the table:

```cshtml
<div id="latestFoodsTableDescription" style="display: none;">
    This table displays a list of prefered products.
</div>
```
