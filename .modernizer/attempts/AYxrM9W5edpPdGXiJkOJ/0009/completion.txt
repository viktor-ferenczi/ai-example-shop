 
The issue with the table is that it does not have a description. This is important for screen readers and other assistive technologies.

Here's how you can add a description:
```cshtml
<table class="table table-hover" id="latestFoodsTable" aria-describedby="latestFoodsTableDescription">
```

And add a description right after the table:
```cshtml
<div id="latestFoodsTableDescription" style="display: none;">This table displays the list of prefered products.</div>
```
