In order to resolve the issue of missing description for the table, we can add a `caption` or `summary` attribute to the table. The `caption` attribute provides a description for the table, which can be read by screen readers. Here is the updated code:

```cshtml
<table class="table table-hover" id="latestFoodsTable" summary="This is a table of prefered products">
```

Please note that the exact text for the summary attribute should be chosen based on the specific needs of your website. The text should clearly describe the content of the table.
