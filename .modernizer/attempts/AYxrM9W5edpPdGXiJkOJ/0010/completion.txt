Given the issue, it seems that the table is missing a description. The issue is reported at the line where the table is defined. To resolve this issue, we can add a description to the table using the `aria-describedby` attribute. Here's the modified code:

```cshtml
<table class="table table-hover" id="latestFoodsTable" aria-describedby="latestFoodsDescription">
    <caption id="latestFoodsDescription">This table displays the most popular foods.</caption>
    <tbody>
        @foreach (var food in Model.FoodsList)
        {
            <tr>
                <td>
                   @Html.Partial("FoodSummary", food) 
                </td>
            </tr>
        }
    </tbody>
</table>
```
