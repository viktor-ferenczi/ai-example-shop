# INSTRUCTION
Consider the following original source code from an ASP.NET service based on .NET Core:
```cshtml
<!-- TOP-MARKER -->
@model Shop.Web.Models.Home.HomeIndexModel

<div class="container body-content">
    <div class="row frontPageSplash">
        <div class="col-md-6 frontPageLearn">
            <div class="frontPageHeading">Healthy, Cheap, Easy...</div>
            <p class="frontPageSubHeading">This is online shopping site for food</p>
            <div>
                <form asp-controller="Home" asp-action="Search" method="post">
                    <input asp-for="SearchQuery" type="text" class="homeSearch" placeholder="Search..." />
                </form>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="row frontPageContent">
        <h3 id="latestFoods">Prefered products</h3>
        <table class="table table-hover" id="latestFoodsTable">
            <tbody>
                @foreach (var food in Model.FoodsList)
                {
                    <tr>
                        <td>
                           @Html.Partial("FoodSummary", food) 
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                }

        </table>

The static code analysis found this issue:
```
Add a description to this table.
```

The issue is reported at these code lines, but it may involve other lines:
```cshtml
        <table class="table table-hover" id="latestFoodsTable">
```

- Issue category: CONVENTIONAL (CONSISTENT)
- Issue severity: MINOR


Please ALWAYS honor ALL of these general rules while resolving the issue:
- Work ONLY from the context provided, refuse to make any guesses.
- Do NOT write any code if you do not have enough information in this context
  to resolve the issue or you do not know how to fix it.
- Do NOT use any kind of placeholders, always write out the full code.
- Do NOT lose any of the original (intended) functionality, remove only the bug. 
- Do NOT apologize.
- Do NOT refer to your knowledge cut-off date.
- Do NOT explain the code itself, we can read it as well.
- Do NOT include excessive comments.
- Do NOT remove original comments unrelated to the issue or the code modified.
- Do NOT break the code's intended functionality.
- Do NOT introduce any performance or security issues.
- Do NOT change comments or string literals unrelated to your task.
- Do NOT remove code (even if it is commented out or disabled) unless asked explicitly.
- Do UPDATE comments which apply to code you have to change.
- ALWAYS write code which is easily readable by humans.


Make sure the understand all the above, then work on resolving the issue by completing these steps:

1. Take a deep breath and think about the problem. Provide a very concise,
   step by step plan for resolving the issue. It will serve only for your 
   reference and not part of the actual output.

2. Stop here and ignore the rest of tasks if and only if you feel that
   some crucial information is missing to properly solve the issue or
   you do not know how to solve it. 

3. Copy the WHOLE original source code with modifications to resolve the issue.
   Your modifications should be concise and limited to the topic of the
   issue. Do NOT modify any code, data or comments unrelated to the issue.
   Do NOT attempt to fix or cleanup anything which is unrelated to the issue.
   Make sure that your changes are compatible with all existing functionality.
   Provide the modified source code in a SINGLE CODE BLOCK without the use of
   any placeholders. Write out the full code, because it will replace the original.

4. Check these failure conditions by reviewing the changes your made to the source code.
   - Are the changes you made fail to fully resolve the issue?
   - Have you missed any related changes humans would expect to be part as your issue resolution? 
   - Have you made any changes, additions or removals to code, data or comments not related to the issue?
   - Has any part of the source code replaced by a placeholder?
   If the answer to all these questions are NO, then approve the code changes
   by saying "APPROVE_CHANGES" and nothing else after the code block.
   If you do not approve the changes, then provide a concise explanation why.

# COMPLETION
 
To address the issue, you can add a description to the table. Here's how you can do it:

```cshtml
<!-- TOP-MARKER -->
@model Shop.Web.Models.Home.HomeIndexModel

<div class="container body-content">
    <div class="row frontPageSplash">
        <div class="col-md-6 frontPageLearn">
            <div class="frontPageHeading">Healthy, Cheap, Easy...</div>
            <p class="frontPageSubHeading">This is online shopping site for food</p>
            <div>
                <form asp-controller="Home" asp-action="Search" method="post">
                    <input asp-for="SearchQuery" type="text" class="homeSearch" placeholder="Search..." />
                </form>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="row frontPageContent">
        <h3 id="latestFoods">Prefered products</h3>
        <table class="table table-hover" id="latestFoodsTable" aria-describedby="latestFoods">
            <tbody>
                @foreach (var food in Model.FoodsList)
                {
                    <tr>
                        <td>
                           @Html.Partial("FoodSummary", food) 
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                }
            </tbody>
        </table>
    </div>
</div>
```

In the `<table>` tag, I've added `aria-describedby="latestFoods"` to associate the table with its title. This is an accessibility feature that helps screen readers to understand the relationship between the title and the table.
