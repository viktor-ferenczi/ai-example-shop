The issue reported is about adding a description to the table. This can be achieved by adding a `<caption>` tag inside the `<table>` tag. Here is the modified code:

```cshtml
<table class="table table-hover" id="latestFoodsTable">
    <caption>Table Description: Prefered products</caption>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Food</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        @foreach (var food in Model.FoodsList)
        {
            <tr>
                <td>
                   @Html.Partial("FoodSummary", food) 
                </td>
            </tr>
        }
    </tbody>
</table>
```
