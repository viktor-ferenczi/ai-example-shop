1. Plan:
   The issue with the "too much branching" is related to the `AddToCart` method. The method currently has a lot of branching logic which can be simplified. 

2. Ignore:
   No missing information or unclear understanding of the issue.

3. Code:
```cs
public bool AddToCart(Food food, int amount)
{
    if (food.InStock == 0 || amount == 0)
    {
        return false;
    }

    var shoppingCartItem = _context.ShoppingCartItems.SingleOrDefault(
        s => s.Food.Id == food.Id && s.ShoppingCartId == Id);
    var isValidAmount = true;
    if (shoppingCartItem == null)
    {
        if (amount > food.InStock)
        {
            isValidAmount = false;
        }
        shoppingCartItem = new ShoppingCartItem
        {
            ShoppingCartId = Id,
            Food = food,
            Amount = Math.Min(food.InStock, amount)
        };
        _context.ShoppingCartItems.Add(shoppingCartItem);
    }
    else
    {
        var remainingStock = food.InStock - shoppingCartItem.Amount;
        if (remainingStock >= amount)
        {
            shoppingCartItem.Amount += amount;
        }
        else
        {
            shoppingCartItem.Amount += remainingStock;
            isValidAmount = false;
        }
    }

    _context.SaveChanges();
    return isValidAmount;
}
```

4. Check:
   - The method now has less branching logic.
   - The method still correctly handles cases where the food is out of stock or the amount to add is zero.
   - The method still correctly handles cases where the food is already in the shopping cart.
   - No placeholders were used.
