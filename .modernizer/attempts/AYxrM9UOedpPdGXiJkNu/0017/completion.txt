 

1. Plan:
   The issue at hand is related to the branching in the `AddToCart` method. The method contains multiple nested if-else statements, which can lead to code that is hard to read and maintain. 

2. Stop here if:
   I have all the necessary information to resolve the issue.

3. Code:
```cs
        public bool AddToCart(Food food, int amount)
        {
            if (food.InStock == 0 || amount == 0)
            {
                return false;
            }

            var shoppingCartItem = _context.ShoppingCartItems.SingleOrDefault(
                s => s.Food.Id == food.Id && s.ShoppingCartId == Id);
            var isValidAmount = true;
            if (shoppingCartItem == null)
            {
                if (amount > food.InStock)
                {
                    isValidAmount = false;
                }
                shoppingCartItem = new ShoppingCartItem
                {
                    ShoppingCartId = Id,
                    Food = food,
                    Amount = Math.Min(food.InStock, amount)
                };
                _context.ShoppingCartItems.Add(shoppingCartItem);
            }
            else
            {
                var newAmount = shoppingCartItem.Amount + amount;
                if (newAmount <= food.InStock)
                {
                    shoppingCartItem.Amount = newAmount;
                }
                else
                {
                    shoppingCartItem.Amount = food.InStock;
                    isValidAmount = false;
                }
            }

            _context.SaveChanges();
            return isValidAmount;
        }
```

4. Check:
   - The changes I made have resolved the issue of excessive branching in the `AddToCart` method.
   - There are no unrelated changes to the code, data or comments.
   - The code is compatible with all existing functionality.
   - The code does not contain any placeholders.
