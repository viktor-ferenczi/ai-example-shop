 

1. Plan:
   - The issue is related to the excessive branching in the `AddToCart` method. It's a code smell indicating that the method is doing too many things.
   - To resolve this, we can refactor the method to make it more readable and maintainable.
   - We can create separate methods for each branch of the condition, reducing the complexity of the `AddToCart` method.

2. Ignore:

   - To resolve this, we can refactor the method to make it more readable and maintainable.
   - We can create separate methods for each branch of the condition, reducing the complexity of the `AddToCart` method.

3. Code:
```cs
public bool AddToCart(Food food, int amount)
{
    if (food.InStock == 0 || amount == 0)
    {
        return false;
    }

    var shoppingCartItem = _context.ShoppingCartItems.SingleOrDefault(
        s => s.Food.Id == food.Id && s.ShoppingCartId == Id);
    var isValidAmount = true;
    if (shoppingCartItem == null)
    {
        isValidAmount = ValidateAndSetAmount(food, amount);
        shoppingCartItem = new ShoppingCartItem
        {
            ShoppingCartId = Id,
            Food = food,
            Amount = isValidAmount ? amount : 0
        };
        _context.ShoppingCartItems.Add(shoppingCartItem);
    }
    else
    {
        isValidAmount = ValidateAndUpdateAmount(shoppingCartItem, food, amount);
    }

    _context.SaveChanges();
    return isValidAmount;
}

private bool ValidateAndSetAmount(Food food, int amount)
{
    if (amount > food.InStock)
    {
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}

private bool ValidateAndUpdateAmount(ShoppingCartItem shoppingCartItem, Food food, int amount)
{
    if (food.InStock - shoppingCartItem.Amount - amount >= 0)
    {
        shoppingCartItem.Amount += amount;
    }
    else
    {
        shoppingCartItem.Amount += (food.InStock - shoppingCartItem.Amount);
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```
