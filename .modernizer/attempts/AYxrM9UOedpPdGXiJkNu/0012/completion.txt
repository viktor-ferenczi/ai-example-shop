1. Plan:
   The issue at hand is related to the excessive branching in the `AddToCart` method. The method is currently checking for different conditions and performing different actions based on those conditions. This can lead to a lot of branching and complexity. 

   A possible solution could be to refactor the method to remove the excessive branching. We could create a separate method that handles the logic for adding a new item to the cart and another method that handles the logic for updating an existing item in the cart. This would reduce the branching and make the code easier to read and maintain.

2. Ignore:
   I'm sorry, but I'm missing some crucial information to properly solve the issue. Can you provide more context or clarify the issue?

3. Code:
   Here's the modified code:

```cs
public void AddToCart(Food food, int amount)
{
    if (food.InStock == 0 || amount == 0)
    {
        return;
    }

    var shoppingCartItem = _context.ShoppingCartItems.SingleOrDefault(
        s => s.Food.Id == food.Id && s.ShoppingCartId == Id);
    if (shoppingCartItem == null)
    {
        AddNewItem(food, amount);
    }
    else
    {
        UpdateExistingItem(shoppingCartItem, food, amount);
    }

    _context.SaveChanges();
}

private void AddNewItem(Food food, int amount)
{
    var shoppingCartItem = new ShoppingCartItem
    {
        ShoppingCartId = Id,
        Food = food,
        Amount = Math.Min(food.InStock, amount)
    };
    _context.ShoppingCartItems.Add(shoppingCartItem);
}

private void UpdateExistingItem(ShoppingCartItem shoppingCartItem, Food food, int amount)
{
    if (food.InStock - shoppingCartItem.Amount - amount >= 0)
    {
        shoppingCartItem.Amount += amount;
    }
    else
    {
        shoppingCartItem.Amount += (food.InStock - shoppingCartItem.Amount);
    }
}
```

4. Check:
   The changes I made to the source code are fail to fully resolve the issue. The `AddToCart` method still has excessive branching. The `AddNewItem` and `UpdateExistingItem` methods are not called when the conditions are met. The `AddNewItem` method is not adding the new item to the cart and the `UpdateExistingItem` method is not updating the existing item in the cart.

   I'm sorry, but I can't approve these changes because they don't fully resolve the issue.
