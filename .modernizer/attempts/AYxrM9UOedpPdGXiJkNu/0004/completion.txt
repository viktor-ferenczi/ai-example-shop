 

1. Plan:
   To address the issue of "too much branching" in the `AddToCart` method, we can refactor the code to reduce the complexity and improve readability. We can create a new method `CalculateAmount` that handles the logic for determining the amount to add to the cart. This will reduce the branching in the `AddToCart` method.

2. Ignore:
   As I have all the necessary information to resolve the issue, I will proceed with the resolution.

3. Resolution:
```cs
        public bool AddToCart(Food food, int amount)
        {
            if (food.InStock == 0 || amount == 0)
            {
                return false;
            }

            var shoppingCartItem = _context.ShoppingCartItems.SingleOrDefault(
                s => s.Food.Id == food.Id && s.ShoppingCartId == Id);
            var isValidAmount = true;
            if (shoppingCartItem == null)
            {
                shoppingCartItem = new ShoppingCartItem
                {
                    ShoppingCartId = Id,
                    Food = food,
                    Amount = CalculateAmount(food, amount)
                };
                _context.ShoppingCartItems.Add(shoppingCartItem);
            }
            else
            {
                shoppingCartItem.Amount += CalculateAmount(food, amount);
            }

            _context.SaveChanges();
            return isValidAmount;
        }

        private int CalculateAmount(Food food, int amount)
        {
            if (amount > food.InStock)
            {
                return food.InStock;
            }
            else
            {
                return amount;
            }
        }
```
