The method is responsible for adding a food item to the shopping cart. It checks if the food item is in stock and if the amount to be added is valid. If the food item is already in the cart, it checks if the amount to be added would exceed the available stock. If so, it adds as much as possible. If not, it adds the entire stock. If the food item is not in the cart, it checks if the amount to be added would exceed the available stock. If so, it adds as much as possible. If not, it adds the entire stock.
