1. The issue at hand is related to the `AddToCart` method. The method has too much branching, which can lead to complex control flow and make the code harder to read and maintain.

2. Here is the revised code:

```cs
public bool AddToCart(Food food, int amount)
{
    if (food.InStock == 0 || amount == 0)
    {
        return false;
    }

    var shoppingCartItem = _context.ShoppingCartItems.SingleOrDefault(
        s => s.Food.Id == food.Id && s.ShoppingCartId == Id);

    if (shoppingCartItem == null)
    {
        if (amount > food.InStock)
        {
            return false;
        }

        shoppingCartItem = new ShoppingCartItem
        {
            ShoppingCartId = Id,
            Food = food,
            Amount = Math.Min(food.InStock, amount)
        };

        _context.ShoppingCartItems.Add(shoppingCartItem);
    }
    else
    {
        if (food.InStock - shoppingCartItem.Amount - amount >= 0)
        {
            shoppingCartItem.Amount += amount;
        }
        else
        {
            return false;
        }
    }

    _context.SaveChanges();
    return true;
}
```

In this revised code, the method now only has two levels of branching, which makes the control flow easier to understand. The method now returns `false` when the amount is invalid, which provides additional information about the error to the caller.
