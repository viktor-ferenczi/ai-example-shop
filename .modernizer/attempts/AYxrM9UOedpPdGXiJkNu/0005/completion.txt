 

1. Plan:
   The issue at hand is related to the method `AddToCart` in the `ShoppingCart` class. It is currently handling the addition of items to the cart, but it has some issues:
   - It's returning a boolean value, but there's no additional information if the amount is invalid. The view decides what error message to show.
   - It's handling application-level logic, which is not its responsibility.
   - It has too much branching, making it hard to read and understand.

2. Code:
   Here's the modified code:

```cs
public class ShoppingCart
{
    // ...

    public (bool isValid, string message) AddToCart(Food food, int amount)
    {
        if (food.InStock == 0 || amount == 0)
        {
            return (false, "Invalid amount");
        }

        var shoppingCartItem = _context.ShoppingCartItems.SingleOrDefault(
            s => s.Food.Id == food.Id && s.ShoppingCartId == Id);

        if (shoppingCartItem == null)
        {
            if (amount > food.InStock)
            {
                return (false, "Not enough stock");
            }

            shoppingCartItem = new ShoppingCartItem
            {
                ShoppingCartId = Id,
                Food = food,
                Amount = Math.Min(food.InStock, amount)
            };

            _context.ShoppingCartItems.Add(shoppingCartItem);
        }
        else
        {
            if (food.InStock - shoppingCartItem.Amount - amount >= 0)
            {
                shoppingCartItem.Amount += amount;
            }
            else
            {
                shoppingCartItem.Amount += (food.InStock - shoppingCartItem.Amount);
                return (false, "Not enough stock");
            }
        }

        _context.SaveChanges();
        return (true, "Item added successfully");
    }

    // ...
}
```

3. Failure conditions:
   - The method now returns a tuple with a boolean indicating if the operation was successful and a string with a message.
   - The method now handles the case when there's not enough stock for the desired amount.
   - The method now handles the case when the amount is invalid.
   - The method now handles the case when the item is already in the cart.
   - The method now handles the case when the item is not in the cart.
   - The method now handles the case when the amount to add is greater than the available stock.
   - The method now handles the case when the amount to add is less than or equal to the available stock.
   - The method now handles the case when the amount to add is greater than the available stock.
   - The method now handles the case when the amount to add is less than or equal to the available stock.
   - The method now saves the changes to the database.
