 

1. The issue at hand is related to the branching in the `AddToCart` method. It's currently too complex and contains multiple levels of branching, which can make the code harder to read and understand.

2. Here is a simplified version of the `AddToCart` method:

```cs
public bool AddToCart(Food food, int amount)
{
    if (food.InStock == 0 || amount == 0)
    {
        return false;
    }

    var shoppingCartItem = _context.ShoppingCartItems.SingleOrDefault(
        s => s.Food.Id == food.Id && s.ShoppingCartId == Id);

    if (shoppingCartItem == null)
    {
        if (amount > food.InStock)
        {
            return false;
        }
        shoppingCartItem = new ShoppingCartItem
        {
            ShoppingCartId = Id,
            Food = food,
            Amount = amount
        };
        _context.ShoppingCartItems.Add(shoppingCartItem);
    }
    else
    {
        if (food.InStock - shoppingCartItem.Amount - amount >= 0)
        {
            shoppingCartItem.Amount += amount;
        }
        else
        {
            shoppingCartItem.Amount = food.InStock;
        }
    }

    _context.SaveChanges();
    return true;
}
```

3. The code block above replaces the original `AddToCart` method. It reduces the branching and complexity, making the code easier to read and understand.

4. The failure conditions are:
   - The method now returns `false` when the amount of food to add to the cart exceeds the available stock.
   - The method now correctly updates the shopping cart item amount when adding more food to the cart.
   - The method now correctly handles the case when the shopping cart item does not exist in the cart.
   - The method now correctly saves the changes to the database after adding the food to the cart.
