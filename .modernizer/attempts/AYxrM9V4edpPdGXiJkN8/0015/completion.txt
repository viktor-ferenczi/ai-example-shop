I'm sorry, but the provided code snippet does not contain any issue that needs to be resolved. It seems to be a part of a view file in an ASP.NET Core application, which is a standard and valid code.

However, if you want to add a description to the table, you can do so by adding a `<caption>` tag within the `<table>` tag. Here's how you can do it:

```cshtml
<table class="table table-hover" id="categoryIndexTable">
    <caption>Table Description</caption>
    <tbody>
        @foreach (var category in Model.CategoryList)
        {
            <tr>
                <td>
                    
                    <div class="categoryLogo" style="background-image: url(@category.ImageUrl); background-size:100%;"></div>
                    <a class="btn btn-info" asp-controller="Category" asp-action="Topic" asp-route-id="@category.Id">
                        @category.Name
                    </a>
                </td>
                <td>
                    @category.Description
                </td>
            </tr>
        }
    </tbody>
</table>
```

Please replace "Table Description" with the actual description you want to add to the table.
