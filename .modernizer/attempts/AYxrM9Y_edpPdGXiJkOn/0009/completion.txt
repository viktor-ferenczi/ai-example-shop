I understand the issue and the context. The 'TODO' comment suggests that we should replace the magic number '10' with a variable. However, the magic number is used in the 'GetPreferred' method, which is a method for getting the preferred foods. It is not clear what the purpose of this magic number is. 

Let's consider replacing the magic number with a variable named 'preferredFoodCount'. Here is the updated code:

```cs
public IEnumerable<Food> GetPreferred(int count)
{
    int preferredFoodCount = count;
    return GetAll().OrderByDescending(food => food.Id).Where(food => food.IsPreferedFood && food.InStock != 0).Take(preferredFoodCount);
}
```
