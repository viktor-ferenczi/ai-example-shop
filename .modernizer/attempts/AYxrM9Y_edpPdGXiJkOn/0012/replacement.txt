public IEnumerable<Food> GetPreferred(int count)
        {
            return GetAll().OrderByDescending(food => food.Id).Where(food => food.IsPreferedFood && food.InStock != 0).Take(count);
        }
```

3. Failure Conditions:
   - The code changes should not break the functionality of getting preferred foods.
   - The changes should not introduce any performance or security issues.
   - The changes should not change any comments or string literals unrelated to the issue.
   - The changes should not remove any code, data or comments unrelated to the issue.
   - The changes should not break any existing functionality.

4. Code:
```cs
        public IEnumerable<Food> GetPreferred(int count)
        {
            const int defaultCount = 10;
            return GetAll().OrderByDescending(food => food.Id).Where(food => food.IsPreferedFood && food.InStock != 0).Take(count > 0 ? count : defaultCount);
        }
