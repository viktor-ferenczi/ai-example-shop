 
The issue reported at the line with the "TODO magic number" comment suggests that a magic number is being used in the code. A magic number is a direct use of a number in the code without explanation or definition. In this case, the magic number is the number 10 in the GetPreferred method.

To resolve this issue, we can replace the magic number with a named constant. This will make the code more readable and maintainable. Here is the modified code:

```cs
public IEnumerable<Food> GetPreferred(int count)
{
    const int preferredCount = 10;
    return GetAll().OrderByDescending(food => food.Id).Where(food => food.IsPreferedFood && food.InStock != 0).Take(preferredCount);
}
```

In this code, `preferredCount` is a named constant that represents the number 10. This makes the code more readable and maintainable.
