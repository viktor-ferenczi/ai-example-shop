 

1. Plan: 
   To resolve the issue with the magic number, we need to replace the magic number '10' with a variable. This variable can be named 'count' and can be passed as a parameter to the method.

2. Code:
```cs
        public IEnumerable<Food> GetPreferred(int count)
        {
            return GetAll().OrderByDescending(food => food.Id).Where(food => food.IsPreferedFood && food.InStock != 0).Take(count);
        }
```

3. Check:
   - The method 'GetPreferred' now takes an integer parameter 'count' which determines the number of preferred foods to return.
   - The magic number '10' is replaced with 'count', which makes the method more flexible and easier to understand.
   - No other changes are made to the code unrelated to the issue.
   - The code is compatible with all existing functionality.
