 
The issue at the marked line is a magic number. A magic number is a direct use of a number in the code without explanation. In this case, the magic number is `10` in the `GetPreferred` method.

Here is the revised code:

```cs
public IEnumerable<Food> GetPreferred(int count)
{
    return GetAll().OrderByDescending(food => food.Id).Where(food => food.IsPreferedFood && food.InStock != 0).Take(count);
}
```
