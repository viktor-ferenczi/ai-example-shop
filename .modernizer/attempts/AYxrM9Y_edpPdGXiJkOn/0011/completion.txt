 
The issue with the magic number is that it's hard-coded in the `GetPreferred` method. This number is used to limit the number of preferred foods returned. If this number changes in the future, it will need to be updated in multiple places.

Here's how you can resolve this issue:

1. First, let's plan our solution. We could make this number a parameter to the `GetPreferred` method. This way, we can easily change it in one place if needed.

2. Now, let's implement the solution. We will replace the magic number with a parameter.

```cs
public IEnumerable<Food> GetPreferred(int count)
{
    return GetAll().OrderByDescending(food => food.Id).Where(food => food.IsPreferedFood && food.InStock != 0).Take(count);
}
```

3. Now, let's check the failure conditions. We will ensure that the number of preferred foods returned is now controlled by the `count` parameter, and not a hard-coded number.

4. If everything is working as expected, we will approve the changes by saying "APPROVE_CHANGES".

```cs
APPROVE_CHANGES
```
