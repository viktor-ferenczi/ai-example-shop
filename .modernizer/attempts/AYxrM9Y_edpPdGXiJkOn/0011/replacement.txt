public IEnumerable<Food> GetPreferred(int count)
{
    return GetAll().OrderByDescending(food => food.Id).Where(food => food.IsPreferedFood && food.InStock != 0).Take(count);
}
```

3. Now, let's check the failure conditions. We will ensure that the number of preferred foods returned is now controlled by the `count` parameter, and not a hard-coded number.

4. If everything is working as expected, we will approve the changes by saying "APPROVE_CHANGES".

```cs
APPROVE_CHANGES
