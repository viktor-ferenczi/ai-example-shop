 
1. Plan:
   The issue is reported on the line where we are checking if the 'MostPopularFoods' collection is empty or not. However, the '.Count()' method is not the most efficient way to check if a collection is empty or not. Instead, we can use the '.Any()' method which is more readable and efficient.

2. Ignore:
   No, I have all the necessary information to resolve the issue.

3. Modified Code:
```cshtml
                    @if(!Model.MostPopularFoods.Any())
```

4. Failure Conditions:
   - The '.Count()' method is replaced with '.Any()' method.
   - The '.Any()' method is used to check if the 'MostPopularFoods' collection is empty or not.
   - No additional changes are made to the code, data or comments unrelated to the issue.
   - The code block is complete and replaces the original code.
