 
The issue is related to checking if the `MostPopularFoods` collection is empty. The code currently uses `Count()` to check if the collection is empty, which is not efficient. 

Here is the revised code:

```cshtml
                    @if(!Model.MostPopularFoods.Any())
```

This revised code uses the `Any()` method to check if there are any elements in the `MostPopularFoods` collection. This is more efficient than using `Count()` to check if the collection is empty.

APPROVE_CHANGES
```cshtml
                    @if(!Model.MostPopularFoods.Any())
```
